appeared in 1856, when he was twenty-eight. The scene is laid in and near contemporary Athens. The story is an animated and delightfully humorous account of 
the adventures befalling two English ladies and a young German scientist, who are 
captured and held for ransom by the redoubtable Hadgi-Stavros, king of the brigands. 
Mrs. Simons is an amusing caricature of British arrogance. "I am an Englishwoman," 
is her constant refrain; and she cannot comprehend how any one dare interfere with 
the rights of herself and her daughter Mary Ann. The Simons family is rich. Hermann Schultze, the young German, is attracted by pretty Mary Ann, and with the 
thrift of his nation, wants to make his fortune by marrying her. He tries to ingratiate 
himself by proposing plans of escape which Mrs. Simons rejects. Hadgi-Stavros 
dictates his private correspondence in the presence of his captives. Thus Schultze 
learns that the king has a large sum of money in a London banking house to which 
Mrs. Simons's brother belongs. She writes to have the amount of her ransom paid; 
and the king is persuaded to give a receipt by which he can be tricked out of the 
amount. Mother and daughter are released. Schultze tries to escape, but fails, and 
is severely punished. He attacks the king, and nearly succeeds in poisoning him. A 
friend in Athens, John Harris, a typical American full of resources, rescues Hermann. 
The king is devoted to his one child Photini, a schoolgirl in Athens. Harris persuades 
Photini aboard his barge, keeps her prisoner, and threatens to treat her as Schultze is 
treated. Thereupon Schultze is released. He afterward narrates the whole story to a 
friend, between whiffs of his long porcelain pipe. This story is one of the most 
brilliant and delightful of <author>About</author>'s telling.</summary>
  <summary author="Addison, Joseph (1672-1719)" title="Cato: A Tragedy, in Five Acts" print_title="Cato:\nA Tragedy,\nin Five Acts"><title>CATO OF UTICA</title>, by <author>Joseph Addison</author>. A tragedy in five acts 
and in blank verse.
It was first represented in 1713. The scene is laid in a hall of the governor's palace
at Utica. The subject is Cato's last desperate struggle against Caesar, and his
determination to die rather than survive his country's freedom. All the "unities"
are strictly observed: there is no change of place, the action occurs on the same
day, and all the incidents centre around Cato and conduce to his death. "Cato"
owed its extraordinary success to the deadly hatred that raged between the Whigs
and Tories at the time: the Whigs cheered when an actor mentioned the word
"liberty"; and the Tories, resenting the implied innuendo, cheered louder than
they. To the Whigs Marlborough was a Cato, to the Tories he was a Caesar.
Bolingbroke, immediately after the performance, gave Booth, the Cato of the
tragedy, fifty guineas "for having so well defended liberty against the assaults of
a would-be dictator" (Alarlborough). Every poet of the time wrote verses in
honor of "Cato," the best being Pope's prologue; and it was translated into French,
German, and Italian. The German adaptation of Gottsched was almost as great
a success as the original.</summary>
  <summary author="Alcott, Louisa May (1832-1888)" title="Little Women" print_title="Little Women"><title>LITTLE WOMEN</title>, by <author>Louisa M. Alcott</author> (1868-69). A story of the daily home life
of four girls in a New England family of half a century ago. The March family is the
author's own family, and the "little women" are herself and her sisters. In the first
chapter Jo, the heroine, is fifteen, a lovable tomboy, with ambition to be a writer.
The oldest sister, pretty Meg, is sixteen and aspiring to be a young lady. Beth is a
shy timid little girl of thirteen, the saint of the family. Golden-haired Amy, the
youngest, tells her sisters that her ambition is to be a great artist and to overcome her
selfishness. Their mother is "a stout motherly lady," with a "can I help you" look
about her, whom the girls know is the most splendid woman in the world. The girls
go to parties, and jolly picnics, act out Pilgrim Progress to make their work more
interesting, and take turns reading aloud to irascible old Aunt March. There are
tragedies as when the proud Amy is obliged by the teacher at school to open her
desk and throw two dozen delicious pickle limes out of the window and have her
hands slapped with a ruler. Jo writes
wonderful melodramas in her den in the attic when genius burns, and the "Witches'
Curse" is acted by the sisters to an admiring audience of girl friends. Their best
friend is Laurie, the boy who lives with his grandfather in the great house next door.
Meg becomes engaged to Laurie's tutor and the first wedding in the family is a great
event. It is a disappointment to girl readers that Jo will not marry Laurie. He
decides to go to Europe to forget her, and says good-bye to them all racing down the
stairs "as if for his life," turning back to ask once more "Oh Jo, can't you?" but she
sends him away. Gentle Beth grows more frail and Jo loses her best loved sister.
Aunt March prefers Amy's politeness to Jo's blunt manners and independent spirit
and invites Amy to go to Europe. Jo struggles along with her stories and goes to
New York to try her literary wings. She intends to be the old maid of the family,
but instead falls in love with a middle-aged German professor, a striking contrast
to the polished boyish Laurie. Laurie meets Amy in Italy and consoles himself with
her. The charm and wholesomeness of the story made it a prime favorite with the
last generation and it remains one of the best juvenile books ever written.</summary>
  <summary author="Aldrich, Mildred (1853-1928)" title="A Hilltop on the Marne Being Letters Written June 3-September 8, 1914" print_title="A Hilltop\non the Marne\nBeing Letters Written\nJune 3-September 8, 1914"><title>HILLTOP ON THE MARNE, A</title>, by <author>Mildred Aldrich</author> (1915). This book, which
evoked great public interest, is in the form of letters written by the author between
June 3, and Sept. 8, 1914, and describes the beginning of the great conflict between
Germany and France. The writer, an American, who has lived many years in France
and become much attached to the country, decides to lease a little house in a hamlet
called Huiry, about thirty miles from Paris. The house is on a hilltop commanding
an extensive view of the river Marne and the surrounding country for many miles.
The first letter describes the writer's delight in her new home, which she occupies
entirely by herself, enjoying the peace and quiet, which surrounds her. She is served
by a farmer's wife named Amelie, who lives nearby, and comes in each day for the
necessary duties. After two months of this pastoral existence all is changed, war is
declared, and the little hilltop becomes a centre of activities. Aeroplanes pass
constantly overhead, troops march by steadily, and the little house becomes a refuge
for all sorts and conditions of men. Officers make their headquarters there, and
men come for rest and refreshment; though the writer is urged by her friends to flee
from the place of danger, she stays bravely by her post, and with the assistance of her
faithful Amelie serves the soldiers untiringly, providing them with everything that
her larder can offer. The battle comes almost to the door of the little house; then
the tide turns and the enemy is repulsed. The writer is an actual witness of the
crisis; she sees the conflict wage and wane from her position on the hilltop, and the
experience which she so graphically and so modestly describes is one that will thrill
every reader.</summary>
  <summary author="Allen, Grant (1848-1899)" title="Linnet A Romance" print_title="Linnet\nA Romance"><title>LINNET</title>, by <author>Grant Allen</author> (1900). This is a romance of the Tyrol and its scenery
and people are described in a manner both effective and pleasing. Two young
English tourists come to a little mountain village where they find the Tyrolese
in all their native simplicity; the young men, with the pride and aspirations
of the hunter, who dance wildly and make love fiercely, and the maidens of easy
virtue who tend their cows in the summer and serve a master in the village through
the long winter. One of these is <title>Linnet</title>, the heroine, an innocent, modest girl among
her bold associates, who possesses a marvelous voice. Both tourists are charmed with
the lovely singer, but while one is selfish and conceited and pays her meaningless compliments, the other, who is quiet and undemonstrative, really wins her love. His
friend, however, being more wise in worldly affairs than himself, persuades him of the
folly of his course, and takes him away from the place. <title>Linnet</title> has other lovers,
among whom is the taciturn inn-keeper, who is a musician and travels with minstrel
troupes of his own training, and who means to marry her as a matter of business.
He takes <title>Linnet</title> with him on his next tour and while she is rapidly becoming famous
she again meets her "Englander" and the love which began in the Tyrolese mountain
again assumes its sway. The love story is told with much charm and grace, and when
the scene changes to London the contrast in character and national traits between
that city and the land of the Tyrol is strikingly shown.</summary>
  <summary author="Aldrich, Thomas Bailey (1836-1907)" title="Marjorie Daw" print_title="Marjorie Daw"><title>MARJORIE DAW</title>, by <author>Thomas Bailey Aldrich</author>. The well-known story of <title>Marjorie
Daw</title> is developed through the correspondence of two young men, named respectively
John Flemming and Edward Delaney. The latter seeks to relieve the tedium of his
friend's sick-room by a description of his neighbor, <title>Marjorie Daw</title>. He paints her
charms in glowing colors, and enlarges upon her attractions, the wealth of her father,
and the delightful colonial mansion in which she dwells. Flemming, who is completely
fascinated with his friend's description, falls in love with the maiden, and
presses Delaney for more and more particulars, which he generously furnishes, until
he has convinced Flemming that <title>Marjorie</title> has been led to reciprocate his feelings.
The critical moment at last arrives when Flemming, having sufficiently recovered,
telegraphs that he intends to press his suit in person. His friend, now realizing how
serious the affair has become, endeavors frantically to prevent Flemming from carrying
out his purpose; but rinding his efforts unavailing, he departs hastily from town
leaving a note of explanation behind him. Flemming arrives, receives Delaney's
note, and encounters the surprise of his life. This short story was first published in
1873, and is a very characteristic piece of <author>Aldrich</author>'s clever workmanship.</summary>
  <summary author="Aldrich, Thomas Bailey (1836-1907)" title="The Story of a Bad Boy" print_title="The Story\nof a\nBad Boy"><title>STORY OF A BAD BOY, THE</title>, by <author>Thomas Bailey Aldrich</author> (1870), is a fresh, humorous
story, that has long been popular with children of all ages. Its opening sentences
tend to explain the dubious title: "This is the story of a bad boy. Well, not such a
very bad, but a pretty bad boy; and I ought to know, for I am, or was, that boy
myself. ... I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself
from those faultless young gentlemen who generally figure in narratives of this kind,
and partly because I was not a cherub. ... In short, I was a real human boy, such
as you may meet anywhere in New England; and no more like the impossible boy in a
story-book than a sound orange is like one that has been sucked dry." The story is
autobiographical in so far as suited the author's purpose. Rivermouth, where the
so-called bad boy of the story was born and brought up, after spending a few of his
earliest years in New Orleans, stands for Portsmouth, New Hampshire: just as his
name, Tom Bailey, stands as a part, not even disguised, of the author's own. Tom
Bailey's temperament and appetites were wholesome; his boyish pranks were never
vicious or mean, though he frankly "didn't want to be an angel," and didn't think
the missionary tracts presented to him by the Rev. Wibird Hawkins were half so
nice as Robinson Crusoe, and didn't send his "little pocket-money to the natives of
the Feejee Islands, but spent it royally in peppermint drops and taffy-candy." The
author, disgusted with the goody-goody little hypocrite of an earlier moral tale,
created this boy of flesh and blood, to displace the moribund hero of "Sandford and
Merton"; though, as <author>Mr. Aldrich</author> has since remarked, "the title may have frightened
off a few careful friends who would have found nothing serious to condemn in the
book itself." The story has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Danish,
Swedish, and Dutch.</summary>
  <summary author="Ariosto, Lodovico (1474-1533)" title="Orlando Furioso" print_title="Orlando Furioso"><title>ORLANDO FURIOSO</title>, by <author>Ludovico Ariosto</author>, a romantic epic of Charlemagne and
his peers, published in forty cantos in 1512, revised and enlarged to forty-six cantos
in 1532. The poem is a continuation of the <title>Orlando Innamorato</title> of Matteo Maria
Boiardo (1434-1494), a great feudal noble of the court of Ferrara, where the French
romances of chivalry were as much in fashion as the newer classical studies. His
epic, left unfinished in 1494, published in 1506, recounts the wars of Charlemagne
and the Saracens with emphasis, not on the religious and heroic motives of the early
French epic, but on the love-affairs of the warriors, who have become as polished and
as susceptible as the knights in the Arthurian romances. <author>Ariosto</author> carries on the
story with greater finish and maturity but less spontaneity. The background of
his narrative is the driving out of France of the army of Saracens, which at the
beginning is besieging Paris under Agramante, King of Africa, aided by Marsilio,
King of Spain, and two formidable champions, Rodomonte and Manricardo. But
the ambuscades, stratagems, single combats, and pitched battles, necessary to drive
them out, are less emphasized than the love of warriors on each side for ladies on
the other. The central theme is the love of Ruggiero, a youth of Christian descent,
brought up among the Saracens, and one of their champions, for a maiden warrior,
Bradamante, sister of Rinaldo, one of the Paladins of Charlemagne. As a compliment 
to his patrons, <author>Ariosto</author> represents this hero and heroine as ancestors of the
House of Este, the ducal family of Ferrara. The numerous vicissitudes of this love story are 
due to the opposing nationality of the lovers and to the schemes of a magician, Atlante, 
who wishes to remove his pupil, Ruggiero, from the dangers of war.
At the opening of the story, for instance, Ruggiero is released by Bradamante from
a tower in which Atlante has confined him; but immediately afterwards he has the
imprudence to mount his tutor's hippogriff, and is carried by this creature to the
Island of the sorceress, Alcina. Fascinated by her beauty and enchantments, he
remains here as her paramour until released by the seer, Melissa, who annuls Alcina's
spells and exposes her in her true ugliness. After a visit to the abode of Logistilla,
or wisdom, Ruggiero departs on his hippogriff, intending to return to Bradamante.
But in passing a small island, he sees a beautiful woman, exposed to a sea-monster
and rescues her, by means of the dazzling rays of a magic shield. The woman is
the beautiful Angelica, beloved of <title>Orlando</title>, and almost all the Paladins and their
opponents but obdurate to all. Even Ruggiero forgets his plighted troth and begin'
to make love to her. But by means of an enchanted ring she becomes invisible and
escapes him.  Though other obstacles have been placed in his way by Atlante, Ruggiero
again meets Bradamante, who forgives his infidelities but insists on his baptism
before she will accept him. Ruggiero gives his promise, but is delayed in its execution 
by the feeling that he should not desert Agramante, his leader, while the war is
going badly for him. Further complication is introduced by Marfisa, a female
warrior on the Moorish side, who becomes attached to Ruggiero and is an active
rival of Bradamante, until it is discovered that Ruggiero and Marfisa are brother
and sister. Again Ruggiero is required to meet Rinaldo, brother to Bradamante,
in single combat; but the outcome is a close friendship. Finally the objections of
the lady's father are met by the chivalrous withdrawal of the Emperor Leo, his
choice for his daughter's hand; and Ruggiero's slaying of Rodomonte, who rebukes
him for his apostasy, is followed by the marriage of the lovers.

Though the madness of <title>Orlando</title> gives the poem its name, this is in reality a 
brilliant episode. <title>Orlando</title> and Rinaldo have been prominent among numerous rivals
for the hand of Angelica, daughter of Galafron, King of Cathay, have followed her
to her own country and return to France just when Paris is besieged. Through the
operation of two magic springs in the forest of Arden, Angelica now hates Rinaldo,
and he passionately loves her, though previously, and by operation of the same
springs Rinaldo hated her and she loved him. <title>Orlando</title> (the Roland of the French
epic) has loved her from the first, unrequited. In the first cantos of Ariosto, Angelica is 
successively pursued by various suitors and at length carried off by sailors
to be exposed, as already explained, to a sea-monster. Rescued from this fate by
Ruggiero -and from Ruggiero by her magic ring she returns to Paris, where, amonp
the Saracen wounded, she finds a beautiful youth, Medoro, whom she nurses back
to health in a herdsman's cottage. She has fallen in love with him, and on his
recovery they are married. After a month of idyllic happiness they set out for the
coast of Spain to embark for Cathay. Meanwhile <title>Orlando</title> in his search for Angelica
comes to the grove where Angelica and Medoro used to meet and notices their names
carved on the trees and stones. The cottager confirms his worst fears. He rushes
again into the woods where long brooding gives way to violent madness. He tears
up the trees, breaks the rocks with his sword, chokes the stream, and having thus
devastated the whole scene, tears off his clothes and lives a wild man, feeding on
roots and raw flesh and offering violence to all who approach him. A dramatic
incident is his meeting with Angelica and Medoro on the coast of Spain, as they are
about to sail for Cathay. He does not recognize Angelica, but he pursues her and
is foiled only by her swiftness. She and Medoro thus escape and sail for her kingdom, while 
<title>Orlando</title> crosses into Africa. Here he later meets and attacks some of
the Paladins, one of whom, Astolfo, has a cure for his malady. Having got possession 
of Ruggiero's hippogriff, Astolfo, among other strange adventures, has soared to
a mountain-top which proved to be the Earthy Paradise and there met the Evangelist
Saint John, by whose aid he ascended in Elijah's fiery chariot, to the moon,
Here in a valley containing everything lost on earth, he found the wits of <title>Orlando</title>
enclosed in a great jar. This jar he now has in this tent and a direct application of
it to Orlando's nostrils restores the madman to his senses. His love is forgotten,
and in a great final combat he does Charlemagne a great service, by skying Agramante, 
the African king. Rinaldo too is cured of his infatuation for Angelica by
a second drink ot the spring which causes hatred.

Infinite variety of incident, unwearied zest for life, rich sensuous color, as in the
canvases of Rubens and Veronese, ease and copiousness of diction, are the leading
qualities of <title>Orlando Furioso</title>. More worldly and satirical than Spenser, <title>Ariosto</title>
lacks his spirituality and seriousness and is much less allegorical; but the general
effect of the two poems is not unlike.

the Times,"</title> by <author>John Ashton</author> (1890. 5th ed. 1906). With 116 illustrations, drawn
by the author from contemporary engravings. Never in the history of the world has
there been such a change in things social as since the beginning of the nineteenth
century; and to those who are watching its close, already at the dawn of the twentieth, 
this work is one of invaluable reference and comparison. The arts, sciences,
manufactures, customs, and manners, were then so widely divergent from those of
to-day, that it seems hardly possible that they belong to the same era, or could have
existed less than one hundred years ago. Steam was then in its infancy; locomotives
and steamships just beginning to be heard of; gas a novel experiment; electricity a
scientific plaything. Beginning with a slight retrospect of the eighteenth century,
the author briefly outlines the influence of Bonaparte in matters political; follows
with a description of the food riots in London; the union with Ireland; death of Lord
Nelson; abolition of the slave trade; amusing photographs of the streets with their
beggars, chimney-sweeps, dealers of small wares and great cries; then the postal
drawbacks and stage-coach infelicities; the famous prisons, notably the Fleet;
museums and museum gardens, theatres and operas; Tattersall's and Gretna Green's
marriages; with innumerable extracts relating to people and places of note; all
taken from original and authentic sources, newspapers being an authority of constant
reference. The quaint illustrations add much to the interest of the work which
extends a little over a decade.

  <summary author="Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo (354-430)" title="The Confessions of St. Augustine" print_title="The Confessions\nof\nSt. Augustine">
<title>CONFESSIONS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE, THE</title>. This famous work, written in 397,
is divided into thirteen books. The first ten contain an account of his life down to
his mother's death, and give a thrilling picture of the career of a profligate and an
idolater who was to become a Father of the Church. We have in them the story of
his childhood, and the evil bent of his nature even then; of his youth and its uncontrollable passions and vices; of his first fall at the age of sixteen, his subsequent
struggle and relapses, and the untiring efforts of his mother, Saint Monica, to save
him. Side by side with the pictures he paints of his childhood (the little frivolities
of which he regards as crimes), and of his wayward youth and manhood, we have his
variations of belief and his attempts to find an anchor for his faith among the Manichseans and Neo-Platonists, and in other systems that at first fascinated and then
repelled him, until the supreme moment of his life arrived, his conversion at the
age of thirty-two. There are many noble but painful pictures of these inward
wrestlings, in the eighth and ninth books. The narrative is intermingled with prayers
(for the Confessions are addressed to God), with meditations and instructions,
several of which have entered into the liturgies of every section of the Christian
Church. The last three books treat of questions that have little connection with the
life of the author: of the opening chapters of Genesis, of prime matter, and the mysteries of the First Trinity. They arc, in fact, an allegorical explanation of the Mosaic
account of the Creation. According to <title>Augustine</title>, the establishment of his
Church, and the sanctification of man, is the aim and end God has proposed to himself
in the creation.</summary>
  <summary author="Aristophanes (-450--388)" title="The Clouds" print_title="The Clouds">CLOUDS, THE ('Nubes'), a comedy by Aristophanes; acted in 423 B. C. Though 
one of the most interesting and poetic of the author's plays, the people refused to hear 
it a second time. But its literary popularity counterbalanced its failure on the stage; 
most unfortunately for Socrates, whose enemies, twenty-five years afterward, found 
in it abundant material for their accusations. Strepsiades, an unscrupulous old rascal 
almost ruined by his spendthrift son Pheidippides, requests the philosopher to teach 
him how to cheat his creditors. The Clouds, personifying the high-flown ideas in 
vogue, enter and speak in a pompous style, which is all lost on Strepsiades. He asks 
mockingly, "Are these divinities?" "No," answers Socrates, "they are the clouds 
of heaven: still they are goddesses for idle people, it is to them we owe our thoughts, 
words, cant, insincerity, and all our skill in twaddle and palaver. " Then he explains 
the causes of thunder, etc., substituting natural phenomena for the personal intervention of the gods; to the great scandal of Strepsiades, who has not come to listen to 
such blasphemy, but to learn how to get rid of his debts. The Clouds tell him that 
Socrates is his man. ' ' Have you any memoranda about you ? ' ' asks the latter. ' ' Of 
my debts, not one; but of what is due me, any number. " Socrates tries to teach his 
new disciple grammar, rhythms, etc.; but Strepsiades laughs at him. Here two new 
characters are introduced, the Just and the Unjust. The former represents old times 
and manners; the latter the new principles taught by the Sophists. When the Just 
taught the young, they did not gad about in the forum or lounge in the bath-rooms. 
They were respectful to their elders, modest and manly. It was the Just who "formed 
the warriors of Marathon. " The Unjust scoffs at such training. If the young may 
not have their fling, their lives are not worth living. "You tell me, " he adds, " that 
this is profligacy. Well, are not our tragic poets, orators, demagogues, and most of 
their auditors profligate?" The Just has to admit this. Strepsiades, discovering 
that the lessons of Socrates are too much for him, sends his clever son to take his place.
Pheidippides becomes an accomplished Sophist, mystifies the creditors, and beats 
his father, all the time proving to him that he is acting logically. The old man, at 
length undeceived, summons his slaves and neighbors, and sets fire to the house and 
school of Socrates. </summary>
  <summary author="Austen, Jane (1775-1817)" title="Emma" print_title="Emma">EMMA, by Jane Austen. The story of 'Emma' is perhaps one of the simplest in all 
fiction, but the genius of Miss Austen manifests itself throughout. All her books 
show keen insight into human nature; but in 'Emma' the characters are so true to 
life, and the descriptions so vivid, that for the time one positively lives in the village 
of Highbury, the scene of the tale. At the opening of the story, Emma Woodhouse, 
the heroine, "handsome, clever, and rich," and somewhat spoilt by a weak fussy 
father, lives alone with him. Her married sister's brother-in-law, Mr. Knightley, is 
a frequent visitor at their house; as is Mrs. Weston, Emma's former governess. Mr. 
Knighttey is a quiet, sensible English gentleman, the only one who tells Emma her 
faults. Finding life dull, Emma makes friends with Harriet Smith, an amiable, 
weak-minded young girl, and tries to arrange a match between her and Mr. Elton, the 
clergyman, but fails. Frank Churchill Mrs. Weston's stepson arrives in the 
village, pays marked attention to Emma, and supplies the town with gayety and 
gossip. Shortly after his departure, a letter brings the news of Hs rich, aunt's death, 
and his own secret engagement to Jane Fairfax, a beautiful girl in Highbury: Emma 
suspects Harriet of being in love with Mr. Churchill, but discovers that she cherishes 
instead a hidden affection for Mr. Knightley. The disclosure fills Emma with alarm, 
and she realizes for the first time that no one but herself must marry him. Fortunately he has long loved her; and the story ends with her marriage to him, that of 
Harriet to Mr. Martin, her rejected lover, and of Jane to Frank Churchill. 

The gradual evolution of her better self in Emma, and her unconscious admiration 
for Mr. Knightley *s quiet strength of character, changing from admiration to love 
as she herself grows, is exceedingly interesting. Chief among the other characters 
are Mr. Woodhouse, a nervous invalid with a permanent fear of colds, and a taste 
for thin gruel; and talkative Miss Bates, who flits from one topic of conversation to 
another like a distracted butterfly. Less brilliant than 'Pride and Prejudice,' 
'Emma' is equally rich in humor, in the vivid portraiture of character, and a never-ending delight in human absurdities, which the fascinated reader shares from chapter 
to chapter. It was published in 1816, when Jane Austen was forty-one. </summary>
  <summary author="Brontë, Charlotte (1816-1855)" title="Jane Eyre: An Autobiography" print_title="Jane Eyre:\nAn Autobiography">JANE EYRE (1847), the novel which established 
Charlotte Brontë’s reputation as a writer of fiction, is in a large degree the record of her 
own development. In the character of Jane Eyre, the young authoress first found an outlet for 
the storm and stress of her own nature. The book is therefore autobiographical in the truest 
sense.   The heroine, Jane Eyre, is an orphan. As a child she is misunderstood and disliked 
by her protectors. She is sent early to Lowood School, an institution charitable in the 
coldest sense of the term. Its original was Cowan Bridge, the school attended by four of the 
Brontë sisters; from which Maria and Elizabeth were removed in a dying condition. The 
description of Jane Eyre’s school days forms one of the most vivid, and in a sense dramatic, 
portions of the novel. After leaving Lowood, she becomes governess to the ward of a certain 
Mr. Rochester, an eccentric man of the world, whose eccentricity is largely the fruit of 
misfortune. He is tied to an insane wife, her insanity being the result of vicious living. 
She is confined at Thornwood, the house of Rochester; but the heroine does not know of her 
existence. Rochester falls in love with Jane Eyre, attracted by her nobility of nature, her 
strength, and her unconventionality; and finally asks her to marry him. His force and his 
love for her win her consent. They are separated at the altar, however, by the revelation of 
the existence of Rochester’s first wife. The two are reunited at last only by a tragedy. 

Charlotte Brontë invested the character of Rochester with a fascination that made him the 
hero in fiction of half the women in England. Jane Eyre herself is no ordinary heroine. Her 
creator had the boldness to reject the pink-and-white Amelia type of woman, that had reigned 
in the novel since Richardson, and to substitute one whose mind, not her face, was her 
fortune. Rochester himself is destitute of gallantry, of all those qualities belonging to the 
ideal lover in fiction. This new departure made the book famous at once. Its literary 
originality was not less striking than the choice of types.</summary>

pains to review it in the Westminster; and Carlyle's name was securely placed on the 
roll of great English authors. Mr. R. H. Hutton pronounced it quite possible that 
it will be "as the author of the 'French Revolution,' a unique book of the century,

for a hundred years any book that comes more direct and namingly from the heart 
of a living man." With almost unequaled power of picturing incidents and portraying characters and scenes, Carlyle flung upon his pages a series of pictures such as 
the pen has rarely executed. He deals less with causes and effects, but for the immediate scenes of the story his power is almost perfect; and his book can never lose its 
living interest for readers, or its value in many ways to students, though it is often 
called a prose poem rather than a history.</summary>

the author's general purpose to mystify the reader. At the storming of Seringapatam, 
a holy city of India, by the British in 1799, a certain John Herncastle possessed 
himself, by the massacre of its keepers, of a large and peculiar diamond 
known as the moonstone. With his dying breath, one of the Brahmins cursed the 
Englishman, declaring that the diamond would bring disaster and misfortune to 
its unlawful possessors. The story treats of the mysterious disappearance of the 
stone, bequeathed by Herncastle to his niece, Miss Verinder, and of the tragedy 
that ensued before the guilty persons could be with certainty apprehended. The 
closing lines of the story find the moonstone once again in India, fixed as formerly 
in the forehead of an idol.</summary>

by James Fenimore Cooper, published in 1841. The hero, Natty Bumppo, called 
Deerslayer in this novel, is represented as a young hunter brought up among the 
Dela wares and engaged in guerilla warfare with the Hurons in the wilderness of 
northern New York State between the years 1740 and 1745. With a gigantic trapper, 
Henry March, nicknamed "Hurry Harry" he defends the family of a settler, Tom 
Hutter, who has built a wooden fortress in the midst of a lonely lake, which he also 
navigates in a kind of house-boat. After a series of exciting adventures in which a 
band of invading Hurons, a Delaware chief, Chingachgook, and a Delaware maiden, 
Wah-ta-wah, are involved, and in the course of which the hero is imprisoned by the 
redskins, the Hurons are driven off with the aid of the British troops. The love of 
Judith Hutter for Deerslayer is not reciprocated, and they part. The other sister, 
Hetty Hutter, who loves Hurry Harry is slain by a chance bullet in the assault by 
the soldiers. Although lacking humor, psychological subtlety, and delicacy of 
characterization this story is of absorbing narrative interest and preserves some 
excellent types of pioneer days.</summary>

dealing with more stirring and elevated situations and scenes. The time of the action 
is 1567-68, when Shakespeare was a boy of three, and Elizabeth was newly established on the throne of England. While the action goes on partly at Avenel Castle, 
and Halbort Glendinning of 'The Monastery' as well as his brother Edward (now 
an abbot), figure prominently in the story, the reader finds that he has exchanged the 
humble events of the little border vale by Melrose for thrilling and romantic adventures at Lochleven Castle on its island in the lake, north of Edinburgh, where 
Mary Queen of Scots is imprisoned; and in place of the braw and bonny Scotch of 
Tibb and Dame Elapeth, we have the hearty English of Adam Woodcock the falconer, 
as masterly a portrait in Scott's gallery as Gurth, Hal o' the Wynd, or Dandie 
Dinmont. The chief interest centres around the unfortunate queen; and the framework of the tale is historically true. The masterpiece of description in 'The Abbot' 
is the signing of the abdication by Mary at the stern insistence of the commissioners 
Lindsay and Ruthven, a scene made famous by more than one great painting

  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="Adam Bede" print_title="Adam Bede">ADAM BEDE, the earliest of George Eliot's novels, was published in 1859, as "by 
the author of 'Scenes of Clerical Life.' The story was at once pronounced by the 
critics to be not more remarkable for its grace, its unaffected Saxon style, and its 
charm of naturalness, than for its perception of those universal springs of action that 
control society, and for that patient development of character and destiny that 
inferior novelists slight or ignore. The chief scene is the Poyser farm in the Midlands, a delightful place of shining kitchens, sweet-smelling dairy-houses, cool green 
porches, wide barns, and spreading woods. Here Mrs. Poyser, a kind-hearted woman 
with an incorrigibly sharp tongue, has taken her husband's niece, Hester Sorrel, 
an ambitious, vain, empty-headed little beauty, to bring up. Adam Bede, the 
village carpenter, an admirable young fellow, is her slave. 

A skeleton of the plot would convey no impression of the strength and charm 
of the story. It seems to have been, in the author's mind, a recognition of the heroism of commonplace natures in commonplace surroundings, of the nobility of noble 
character wherever found. But Adam Bedc, intelligent, excellent, satisfactory 
though he is, is quite subordinated in interest to the figure of poor Hetty, made 
tragic through suffering and injustice. Her beauty, her vanity, her very silliness, 
cndeur her. Dinah Morris, the woman preacher, is a study from life, serene and 
lovely. Mr. I r wine, the easy-going old parson, is a typical English clergyman of the 
early nineteenth century; IJartle Massey, the schoolmaster, is one of those humble 
folk, full of character, foibles, absurdities, and homely wisdom, whom George Eliot 
draw?; with loving touches; while Mrs. Poysor, with her epigrammatic shrewdness, 
her untiring energy, her fine pride of respectability, her acerbity of speech, and her 
charity of heart* belongs to the company of the Immortals.

Anne Bronte herself, the unpleasant side of such a position being set forth. The 
book, however, ends happily in the marriage of Agnes to a clergyman. Although well

then deserts, a girl of humble parentage. The young mother dies of grief, and Elsie, 
the grandmother, takes Agnes to Sorrento, where she lives by selling oranges in the

T. Coleridge, which appeared in 1825, is a collection of moral and religious aphorisms, with commentaries. While these are not 
sequentially connected, they are yet so arranged as to illustrate the author's purpose, 
to address his thought to the unspiritual but reflecting mind of the supposed pilgrim, 
who is led from worldly-mindedness to the acceptance of spiritual religion. Coleridge 
takes up the argument on the pilgrim's (imputed) principles of worldly calculation. 
Beginning with religion as Prudence, resultant from the sense and sensuous understanding, he ascends to the ground of morality, as inspired by the heart and conscience, and finally to Spiritual Religion, as presented by reason and the will. 

This argument is by no means patent to the casual reader, for the author addresses himself to the heart rather than to the reasoning faculties. The doctrines 
of the book are held to be those of the Church of England, broadly interpreted. 
The language is choice; and notwithstanding the philosophical and somewhat sententious nature of the treatment, the book is eminently readable, exhibiting, in 
several passages, Coleridge's prose at its best.</summary>

  <summary author="Thompson, Maurice (1844-1901)" title="Alice of Old Vincennes" print_title="Alice\nof\nOld Vincennes">ALICE OP OLD VINCENNES, by Maurice Thompson, was published in 1900. 
The scene of the story is laid in old Vincennes on the Wabash, in 1778, and describes 
the life of the northwest during the Revolutionary period. The heroine, Alice 
Roussillon, by birth a Tarleton, and therefore a member of one of the "first" Colonial 
families, has been stolen in her infancy and educated as a Creole girl amid the hardships of pioneer life and the uncertainty of Indian warfare. Her adopted father is 
Gaspard Roussillon, a successful French trader with the Indians, and Alice grows up 
strong and beautiful and an expert with gun and sword. Lieutenant Beverly, Alice's 
lover, is a man of aristocratic birth whose affection for one he considers a simple 
creole girl portends a hard struggle between his patrician feelings and his love. 
However, this obstacle is removed by the discovery of Alice's true lineage, and, 
after many exciting adventures, she and Beverly are at length united. There are 
many thrilling episodes described in the story, among which may be mentioned the 
rescue of the settlement by the young American Colonel George Rogers Clark, who 
puts the British soldiers to route after one of the most trying marches ever described 
in fiction. Among the conspicuous characters in the tale is good old Pere Beret, 
who is a mountain of strength in more ways than one, and his duel with Colonel 
Hamilton over the supposed dead body of Alice is powerfully described. The Indians 
are most graphically pictured and "Long Hair," with his craft and cruelty, savage 
nobility and meanness, and splendid but hideous physique, is one of the most picturesque figures in the book. Old frontier life in all its rudeness and simplicity is 
vividly portrayed, and the stirring times when men went about with scalps hanging 
at their belts are brought forcibly before the reader. </summary>

Search for the Absolute), is a striking novel by Honore de Balzac. The scene 
is laid in the Flemish town of Douai early in the last century; and the tale gives, 
with all the author's care and richness of detail, a charming representation of Flemish 
family life. The central character, Balthazar Claes, is a wealthy chemist, whose 
ancestral name is the most respected and important in the place. His aim, the dream 
of his life, is to solve the mystery of matter. He would by chemical analysis discover 
the secret of the absolute. Hence he toils early and late in his private laboratory: 
everything is given up to the god of science. Gradually the quest becomes a fixed 
idea, for which money, family, health, sanity, are sacrificed. Claes dies heart-broken 
and defeated; a tragic figure, touching in its pathos, having dignity even in its 
downfall. As foils to him stand his devoted wife and his eldest daughter Marguerite, 
noble women, the latter one of the finest creations of Balzac's genius. They sympathize sorrowfully yet tenderly with his ideal, and bear with true heroism the misery 
to which his mad course subjects them. Simple in its plot, the story displays 
some of the deepest human passions, and is a powerful romance. It belongs to 
that series of the Human Comedy known as 'Philosophical Studies' and appeared 
in 1834. </summary>

which came to the poet from Boccaccio, through Paynter's 'Palace of Pleasure, 
although he introduces variations. It tells how Helen de Narbon, a physician's 
daughter, and orphaned, forced her love on a handsome and birth-proud young 
French nobleman, Bertram de Rousillon, with whom she had been brought up from 
childhood. It is a tale of husband-catching by a curious kind of trick. Helena 
heals the king with her father's receipt, asks for and accepts Bertram as her reward, 
and is married. But the proud boy flies to the Florentine wars on his wedding-day, 
leaving his marriage unconsummated. Helen returns sorrowfully to Rousillon; and 
finds there a letter from her husband, to the effect that when she gets his ring upon 
her finger and shows him a child begotten of his body, then he will acknowledge her 
as his wife. She undertakes to outwit him and reclaim him. Leaving Rousillon on 
pretense of a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jacques le Grand, she presently contrives to have it thought she is dead. In reality she goes to Italy, and becomes Bertram's wife in fact and not mere name, by the secret substitution of herself for the 
pretty Diana, with whom he has an assignation arranged. There is an entanglement 
of petty accidents and incidents connected with an exchange of rings, etc. But  
finally, Helen makes good before the King her claim of having fulfilled Bertram's 
conditions; and she having vowed obedience, he takes her to his heart, and we may 
suppose they live happily together "till there comes to them the destroyer of delights 
and the sunderer of societies." One's heart warms to the noble old Countess of 
Rousillon, who loves Helen as her own daughter. She is wise and ware in worldly 
matters, and yet full of sympathy, remembering her own youth. Parolles is a cross 
between Thersites and Pistol, a volte-faced scoundrel who has to pull the devil by 
the tail for a living. His pretense of fetching off his drum, and his trial blindfolded 
before the soldiers, raises a laugh; but the humor is much inferior to that of Henry 
IV.</summary>

It consists of the plays of Shakespeare transposed into narrative form the comedies

Almayer, the son of a Dutch official in Java, has been adopted in a sort of way by 
one Captain Lingard, a disreputable English adventurer, who persuades him to 
marry a Malay girl, whom also he has adopted, the sole survivor of a crew of Malay 
pirates sent by Lingard to their last account. The story is crowded with adventure, 
and the characters stand out, living creatures, against a gorgeous tropical background. 
But its merit lies in its careful rendering of race traits, and in its study of that dry-rot 
of character, indecision, irresolution, procrastination. It is quite plain that the sins

Kingsley's broad humanitarianism, unconventionality, interest in and sympathy for 
the wrongs of the English working classes. It made a great stir, and did much in 
England to turn the thoughts of the upper ranks to their responsibility for the lower. 
Its hero is a poet-tailor of a mystic turn 'Alton Locke, Tailor and Poet,' is the

works of fiction, as well as one of the most famous novels of the eighteenth century. 
He was forty-four when it appeared, and in impaired health. It has, perhaps for 
this reason, less of the exuberant vitality which characterized 'Tom Jones' a novel 
preceding it by two years. The plot is more serious; but in a rich, quiet fund of 
humor it is not far behind that masterpiece. In 'Amelia/ Fielding drew the portrait 
of a virtuous and lovely wife; his own, it is believed, furnishing the model. It is a 
story of married life. Mr. Booth, the husband of the heroine, an impoverished 
gentleman, is introduced to the reader in prison, where he has been taken for participation in a street quarrel. His companion there, Miss Matthews, is a handsome 
young woman of easy virtue, who has murdered her betrayer. The relations of 
Booth and this woman are improper; but the husband is saved from this, as from 
other faults of conduct, by the purity, goodness, and devotion of Amelia, whom he 
devotedly loves. Eventually she brings him a fortune, he is released from prison, 
and happiness reigns. In contrasting Booth's poorer nature with the noble character 
of his wife, Fielding is supposed to have had himself in mind. It is noteworthy that 
the novelist, in depicting her, emphasized her beauty of mind and heart by stating 
that her bodily beauty was marred through the disfigurement of her nose in a carriage 
accident. The story is strong in portraiture of character, in sincerity, in analysis of 
motive, and in wit. </summary>

adopted to connect it with two preceding volumes, 'Curiosities of Literature' and 
' Miscellanies of Literature.' As the author relates in the preface, it forms a portion 
of a great work projected, but never accomplished. "A history of our vernacular 
literature has occupied my studies for many years. It was my design, not to furnish 
an arid narrative of books or of authors, but following the steps of the human mind 
through the wide track of time, to trace from their beginning the rise, progress, and 
decline of public opinions. ... In the progress of these researches many topics 
presented themselves, some of which from their novelty and curiosity courted investigation. Literary history, in this enlarged circuit, becomes not merely a philological 
history of critical erudition, but ascends into a philosophy of books. " In the midst 
of his studies toward the working-out of this design, Disraeli was arrested by loss of 
sight. The papers in ' Amenities of Literature ' form a portion of the projected history. 
The first volume consists of thirty-eight chapters on subjects connected with early 
English life and literature; among them The Druidical Institution; Cacdmon and 
Milton; Dialects; Early Libraries; The Ship of Fools; and Roger Ascham. The second 
volume, possessing less unity of design, has thirty-two chapters on subjects strange, 
familiar, and quaint: Rhyming Dictionaries are treated of; Allegories and the Rosicrucian Fludd are discussed. There are chapters on Sir Philip Sidney, on Spenser, 
Hooker, and Drayton, and a dissertation on Pamphlets. The book as a whole is a 
pleasant guide into the half-hidden by-paths of English literary history. It is a

witty, satirical, gracious, and refined, a valiant upholder of sane and wholesome 
ideals. Her essays ridicule the defects and strive to encourage the merits of American 
social life. 'A Question of Politeness' attacks the common delusion that rudeness 
is a mark of sincerity. In 'The Mission of Humor' she criticizes the cheap wit of the 
comic supplements and the lack of intellectual content in American humor. 'Goodness and Gayety' pleads for the union of wit and sanctity. 'The Nervous Strain' 
attempts to check the American habit of rush and worry by an appeal to common-sense and to the sayings of Marcus Aurelius. 'The Greatest of these is Charity' is a 
satire on the charitable enterprises of wealthy American women. .Other essays are
'The Girl Graduate,' 'The Estranging Sea,' 'The Customary Correspondent,' and 
'The Condescension of Borrowers.' The style is finished, and refined, and attrao 
tively combines gayety and seriousness. </summary>
  <summary author="Amiel, Henri Frédéric (1821-1881)" title="Amiel's Journal: The Journal Intime of Henri-Frédéric Amiel" print_title="Amiel's Journal:\nThe Journal Intime\nof\nHenri-Frédéric Amiel">AMIEL'S JOURNAL, a selection of daily meditations from the diary of Henri 
Frederic Amiel, who was a professor of aesthetics and later of philosophy at the 
University of Geneva, but published little, putting his best work into this 'Journal 
Intime,' which extends from 1848 to 1881, the year of his death, and appeared in 1882. 
A good English translation by Mrs. Humphry Ward was published in 1889. The 
work consists of detached meditations of a philosophic, religious, descriptive, and 
personal character written in a lucid, aphoristic style. Amiel was a man of reflective 
temperament and had the habit of introspection, fostered by a skeptical and analyzing 
age. Four years of philosophical studies in Germany had intensified this tendency, 
and directed his contemplations too exclusively to the infinite, paralyzing his will 
and his power of seeking positive truth. Some of the entries in the journal express a 
yearning for Nirvana, for absorption in the universe; in others he attempts to fuse 
into one the most diverse systems of thought. Others are nicely discriminating 
appreciations of literature and art, or penetrating criticisms of society and national 
life. Concerning religion Amiel disbelieves in the permanency of dogma but holds 
that an element of faith is essential if religion is to retain its power over the masses. 
He maintains the unity of the religious aspirations beneath diverse creeds. His 
descriptions of Genevan landscape show genuine power of suggesting the spiritual 
presence immanent in nature.</summary>
  <summary author="Xenophon (-431--355)" title="Anabasis" print_title="Anabasis">ANABASIS, THE ('Retreat of the Ten Thousand,' 401-399 B. C.), by Xenophon. 
The word means the going up or expedition, i. e., to Babylon,, the capital of the 
Persian Empire; but most of the narrative is occupied with the retreat. The 
occasion of the famous expedition was the attempt of Cyrus the Younger to 
unseat his elder brother Artaxerxes from the throne of Persia by aid of a Greek army, 
which he gathered in or near his satrapy in Asia Minor, and then moved swiftly 
across Persia against the miscellaneous barbarian hordes of his brother with their 
small centre of disciplined Persian guards. The plan succeeded, and Cyrus was about 
to win the great battle of Cunaxa, when he was killed in the fray, and the Ten Thousand were left leaderless and objectless in the heart of a hostile empire a thousand 
miles from their kin. To complete their ruin, all the head officers were decoyed 
into a mock negotiation by Artaxerxes and murdered to a man. In their despair, 
Xenophon, a volunteer without command, came forward, heartened them into holding together and fighting their way back to the Euxine, and was made leader of the 
retreat; which was conducted with such success, through Persia and across the snow-clad Armenian mountains, against both Persian forces and Kurdish savages, that the 
troops reached Trapezus (Trebizond) with very little loss. Even then their dangers 
were not over: Xenophon had now to turn diplomatist; to gain the good graces of the 
Greek cities on the Black Sea, and to negotiate with Seuthes the Thracian king who 
tried to assassinate him, and with the governors of the different cities subject to 
Sparta. At last the adventure was over. Many of the survivors went back to Greece; 
but the larger number took service under Spartan harmosts, and were subsequently 
instrumental in freeing several Greek cities in Asia Minor. 

Merely as a travel sketch the tale is highly interesting. The country traversed 
in Persia was almost utterly unknown to the Greeks: and Xenophon makes memoranda in which he enumerates the distances from one halting-place to another; 
notes the cities inhabited or cities deserted; gives a brief but vivid description of a 
beautiful plain, a mountain pass, a manoeuvre skillfully executed, or any amusing 
episode that falls under his eye. And we find that camp gossip and scandal were as 
rife, as rank, and as reliable as in other ages. He is especially delightful in his portraits, sketched in a few sentences, but vigorous and lifelike: Cyrus, a man at once 
refined and barbarous, an impressive picture of a Persian prince brought in contact 
with Greek civilization; Clearchus, the type of an excellent general, upright but 
harsh; Proxenus, a fine gentleman, but too soft and weak; the unscrupulous Merion, a 
natural product of civil dissension. Xenophon tells the story in the third person, 
after the fashion in the classic times; and if he makes himself out a most eloquent, 
courageous, resourceful, and self-sacrificing leader, his other work makes one willing 
to accredit him cheerfully. </summary>

the tempter of man. In the prologue he stands outside the gates of eternity, and 
calls on the silent Guardian to open them for an instant that he may have a glimpse 
of the mysteries to illumine the way for the Devil and for man, alike groping in 
darkness. The Guardian bars the way, and in anger Anathema swears to return to 
earth and ruin the soul of David Leizer. David Leizer is not a Faust or a Job, but an 
insignificant Jewish shopkeeper dying of poverty in a Russian town. Anathema 
appears to him as a lawyer to announce that he has inherited a fortune. David 
divides his wealth among the poor and outcast. His attempt to help his fellow-man 
results in strife and bloodshed. His millions are not sufficient, and the mob stones 
him to death because he does not work miracles to clothe and feed them and bring 
back the dead to life. Anathema in an epilogue again approaches the eternal gates 
and challenges the Guardian to answer him. Did not David manifest in his life and 
death the powerlessness of love and create a great evil? The Guardian replies that 
David has attained immortality, but that Anathema will never know the secret of life. </summary>

covering so wide a range of subjects as to render classification impossible. This 
torrent of erudition flows in channels scientifically exact. Melancholy is treated as 
a malady, first in general, then in particular. Its nature, seat, varieties, causes, 
symptoms, and prognosis are considered in an orderly manner, with a great number 
of differentiations. Its cure is next examined, and the various means discussed 
which may be adopted to accomplish this. Permissible means, forbidden means, 
moral means, and pharmaceutical means are each analyzed. After disposing of the 
scholastic method, the author descends from the general to the particular, and treats 
of emotions and ideas minutely, endeavoring to classify them. In early editions of 
the book, there appear at the head of each part, synoptical and analytical tables, 
with divisions and subdivisions, each subdivision in sections and each section in 
subsections, after the manner of an important scientific treatise. While the general 
framework is orderly, the author has filled in the details with most heterogeneous 
material. Every conceivable subject is made to illustrate his theme: quotations, brief 
and extended, from many authors; stories and oddities from obscure sources; literary 
descriptions of passions and follies; recipes and advices; experiences and biographies.</summary>
  <summary author="Maine, Henry Sumner, Sir (1822-1888)" title="Ancient Law: Its Connection to the History of Early Society" print_title="Ancient Law:\nIts Connection\nto the History\nof Early Society">ANCIENT LAW, by Henry Sumner Maine (1861). In his remarkable work on 
'Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation 
to Modern Ideas,' Sir Henry Maine attempted to indicate some of the earliest ideas 
of mankind, as reflected in ancient law, and to point out the relation of those ideas to 
modern thought. To a large extent the illustrations were drawn from Roman law, 
because it bears in its earliest portions traces of the most remote antiquity, and at the 
same time it supplies many elements of modern culture. A principal contention of 
Maine was that patriarchal or fatherly authority was the earliest germ of social order. 
The distinction given the author by this work led to his having a seven years' period 
of service in India as legal member of the Council; and on his return to England and 
appointment to a professorship of jurisprudence at Oxford, his first course of lectures 
was published as 'Village Communities' (1871). It was another course of Oxford 
lectures which gave the substance of his 'History of Early Institutions' (1875); in 
which, as in 'Village Communities,' he drew from knowledge gained in India to throw 
light upon ancient social and political forms. Not only were these works among the 
first examples of thorough historical research into the origins of social order and 
political organization, but the skill in exposition and admirable style in which they 
are executed make them of permanent interest as models of investigation. The work 
of Maine on the origin and growth of legal and social institutions was completed by 
a volume in 1883 on 'Early Law and Custom.' His effort is still to reconcile the 
growth of jurisprudence with the results obtained by modern anthropology, while 
each study is made to explain and illuminate the other. Beginning with the primitive religion and law, as disclosed in the earliest written monuments preserved in 
the sacred Hindoo laws, the rise of the kingly power and prerogative and the meaning 
of ancestor- worship are discussed. The book closes with a study of the feudal theory 
of property, and its effect upon modern systems of rental and landholding. </summary>

after twelve hundred years of development, existed in 1789; the part which clergy, 
nobles, and king played in it; the organization of politics, society, religion, and the 
church; the state of industry, education, science, and letters; and the condition of the 
people: with reference especially to the causes which produced the French Revolution, 
and through that catastrophic upheaval created a new France. Not only the more 
general facts are brought to view, but the particulars of industrial, domestic, and 
social life are abundantly revealed. First the structure of society is examined; then 
the habits and manifestations of character which were most notably French; then 
the elements of a dawning revolution, the representative figures of a new departure, 
master minds devoted to new knowledge; philosophers, scientists, economists, seeking 
a remedy for existing evils; then the working of the new ideas in the public mind; 
and finally the state of suffering and struggle in which the mass of the people were. 
A masterly study of great value for the history of France and for judgment of the 
future of the French Republic. Taine's phenomenal brilliancy of style and picturesqueness of manner, his philosophical contemplation of data, and his kean reasoning, 
have never been more strikingly exhibited than in these volumes, which are as absorbing as fiction.</summary>

by James Orton (1870). In 1868, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Orton, who for many years was professor of natural history in Vassar 
College, led an exploring expedition to the equatorial Andes and the river Amazon; 
the experiences of the party being vivaciously set forth in this popular book. Before 
this exploration, as Mr. Orton explains, even central Africa had been more fully 
explored than that region of equatorial America which lies in the midst of the western 
Andes, and upon the slopes of those mountain monarchs which look toward the 
Atlantic. A Spanish knight, Orellana, during Pizarro's search for the fabled city of 
El Dorado in 1541, had descended this King of Waters (as the aborigines called it); 
and with the eyes of romance, thought he discovered on its banks the women warriors 
for whom he then newly named the stream the "Amazon," a name still used by 
the Spaniards and the Portuguese in the plural form, Amazonas. Except for one 
Spanish exploration up the river in 1637, the results of which were published in a 
quaint and curious volume, and one French exploration from coast to coast eastward 
in 1745, and the indefatigable missionary pilgrimages of Catholic priests and friars, 
the great valley remained but vaguely known. National jealousies had kept the 
river closed to foreign navigation, until, by a larger policy, it was made free to 
the flags of all nations in 1867. 'The Andes and the Amazon' is not intended to be 
a scientific record of newly discovered data. Whatever biological or archaeological 
contributions it offers are sufficiently intelligible and accurate, and there is scattered 
through the three hundred and fifty pages of the book a large amount of general 
information, such as a trained observer would instinctively gather, and an intelligent 
audience delight to share.</summary>
  <summary author="Tolstoy, Leo, graf (1828-1910)" title="Anna Karenina" print_title="Anna Karenina">ANNA KARENINA, a famous novel of contemporary life, by Count Lyof Tolstoy 
(1873-76), was first published as a serial in the Russian Contemporary, an English 
translation, appearing in 1886. The remarkable character of the book places it in 
the category of world-novels. Its theme the simple one of the wife, the husband, 
and the lover is treated with a marvelous perception of the laws of morality and 
of passion. The author depicts the effect upon a high-bred sensitive woman of the 
violation of the moral code, through her abandonment to passion. The character of 
Anna Karenina is the subject of a subtle psychological study. A Russian noblewoman, young, beautiful, and impressionable, she is married to a man much older 
than herself. While visiting in Moscow, in the household of her brother Prince 
Stepan Oblonsky, she meets Count Vronsky, a brilliant young officer. He loves her, 
and exercises a fascination over her which she cannot resist. The construction of the 
novel is intricate, involving the fortunes of many other characters; fortunes which 
present other aspects of the problems of love and marriage. The interest is centred, 
however, in Anna Karenina. No criticism can convey the powerful impression of 
her personality, a personality colored by the mental states through which she passes, 
dawning love, blind passion, maternal tenderness, doubt, apprehension, defiance, 
sorrow, and finally despair. The whole of a woman's heart is laid bare. The realism 
of Anna Kare'nina is supreme and merciless. Its fidelity to the life it depicts, its 
strong delineation of character, above all its masterly treatment of a theme of world-wide interest, place it among the first novels of the nineteenth century. </summary>

(1876). A work of highly practical fiction, telling the story through successive ages 
of an ideal fortress, supposed to have been situated at a point on a branch of the 
Sa6ne River which is now of special importance in view of the present eastern frontier of France. The story follows the successive ages of military history frcm early 
times down to the present, and shows what changes were made in the fortress to 
meet the changes in successive times in the art of war. The eminence of the author, 
both as an architect and military engineer, enabled him to design plans for an ideal 
fortress, and to give these in pictorial illustrations. The work is as entertaining to 
the reader as it is instructive to the student of architecture, and the student of war 
for whom it is especially designed. </summary>
  <summary author="MacDonald, George (1824-1905)" print_title="Annals of a Quiet\nNeighbourhood" title="Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood">ANNALS OF A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD, by George Macdonald (1866), records 
a young vicar's effort to be a brother as well as a priest to his parishioners; and tells 
incidentally how he became more than a brother to Ethelwyn Oldcastle, whose 
aristocratic, overbearing mother, and madcap niece Judy, have leading r61es in the 
story. At first Judy's pertness repels the reader; but like the bad boy who was not 
so very bad either, she wins increasing respect, and is able, without forfeiting it, to 
defy her grandmother, the unlovely Mrs. Oldcastle, whose doting indulgence has 
come so near ruining her disposition. Anyone wishing to grasp the true inwardness, 
as well as the external features, of the life of an English clergyman trying to get on 
to some footing with his flock, has it all here in his own words, with some sensational 
elements intermingled, for which he makes ample apology. But the book on the 
whole is free from puritanical self-arraignment. The constant moralizing never 
becomes tiresome, as in some of the author's later work.- "If I can put one touch 
of rosy sunset into the life of any man or woman of my cure, I shall feel that I have 
woiked with God," mutters the young vicar on overhearing a lad exclaim that he 
should like to be a painter, because then he could help God paint the sky; and this 
hope, the first the clergyman dares form, is equally carried out in the case of rich and
poor. With regard to both these divisions of society there is much wholesome plain-speaking, as where it seems to the vicar "as if the rich had not quite fair play; . . . 
as if they were sent into the world chiefly for the sake of the cultivation of the virtues 
of the poor, and without much chance for the cultivation of their own." From this 
acute but pleasant preamble to his heart-warming "God be with you" at the end, 
this mellow character, capable of innocent diplomacy and of sudden firmness upon 
occasion, only loses his temper once, and that is when the intolerable Mrs. Oldcastle 
makes a sneering reference to the "cloth." </summary>
  <summary author="Galt, John (1779-1839)" title="The Annals of the Parish" print_title="The Annals\nof the Parish">ANNALS OF THE PARISH, by John Gait, a native of Ayrshire, Scotland, 
was published in 1821. In the spirit, if not in the letter, this work is the direct ancestor of the tales of Maclaren and Barrie. Although it cannot properly be called 
a novel, it is rich in dramatic material. It purports to be written by Mr. Balwhidder, 
a Scottish clergyman, who recounts the events in the parish of Dalmailing 
where he ministered. He carries the narrative on from year to year, sometimes 
recording an occurrence of national importance, sometimes a homely happening, 
as that William Byres's cow had twin calves "in the third year of my ministery." 
There was no other thing of note this year, "saving only that I planted in the garden the big pear-tree, which had two great branches that we call the Adam and 
Eve." Concerning a new-comer in the parish he writes: "But the most remarkable 
thing about her coming into the parish was the change that took place in the Christian names among us. Old Mr. Hooky, her father, had, from the time he read his 
Virgil, maintained a sort of intromission with the nine Muses by which he was led 
to baptize her Sabrina, after a name mentioned by John Milton in one of his works. 
Miss Sabrina began by calling our Jennies Jessies, and our Nannies Nancies. . . . 
She had also a taste in the mantua-making line, which she had learnt in Glasgow; 
and I could date from the very Sabbath of her first appearance in the Kirk, a change 
growing in the garb of the younger lassies, who from that day began to lay aside 
the silken plaidie over the head, the which had been the pride and bravery of their 
grandmothers." 

The 'Annals' are written in a good homely style, full of Scotch words and Scotch 
turns of expression. The book holds a permanent place among classics of that 
country.</summary>

plot centres in Ward Heathcote's ardent and abiding love for Anne, and her equally

in 1888. Its heroine, a woman in her later youth, returns to her native New England village after a prolonged sojourn in Rome, terminated by the death of her 
father. Her foreign environment has unfitted her for sympathetic residence with 
the friends of her girlhood, yet it has not diminished the insistency of her Puritan 
conscience. She does good with malice prepense, and labors to be a power for well-being in the community. Her acquaintance with a fervid young minister increases 
her moral intensity. She makes many mistakes, however, and grieves over them with 
feminine uselessness of emotion. At last she finds her balance-wheel in Dr. Morrell, 
a healthy-minded man. Annie is an excellent portrait of a certain type of woman. 
Her environment, the fussy "good society" of a progressing New England village, 
is drawn with admirable realism; while the disintegrating effect of the new industrial 
order upon the older and simpler life of narrow ambitions and static energy is skillfully suggested. </summary>

many of the scenes described in the 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' are 
reset to suit the purpose of the author. Only two historical personages are introduced into the story, the Emperor Honorius, and Alaric the Goth; and these 
attain only a secondary importance. Among the historical incidents used are the 
arrival of the Goths at the gates of Rome, the Famine, the last efforts of the besieged, the Treaty of Peace, the introduction of the Dragon of Brass, and the collection of the ransom, most of these accounts being founded on the chronicles of 
Zosimus. The principal characters are Antonina, the Roman daughter of Numarian; Hermanric, a Gothic chieftain in love with Antonina; Goisvintha, sister to 
Hermanric; Vetranio, a Roman poet; Ulpius, a pagan priest; Numarian, a Roman 
Christian, father of Antonina and a fanatic; and Guillamillo, a priest. This book 
does not show the intricacy of plot and clever construction of the author's modern 
society stories; but it is full of action, vivid in color, and sufficiently close to history 
to convey a dramatic sense of the Rome of Honorius and the closing-in of the barbarians. </summary>

Roman plays, 'Julius Caesar' being the first. For breadth of treatment and richness of canvas it excels the latter. There is a splendid audacity and self-conscious 
strength, almost diablerie, in it all. In Cleopatra, the gipsy sorceress queen, the 
gorgeous Oriental voluptuousness is embodied; in the strong-thewed Antony, the 
stern soldier-power of Rome weakened by indulgence in lust. There is no more 
affecting scene in Shakespeare than the death, from remorse, of Enobarbus. In 
the whole play the poet follows North's 'Plutarch 7 for his facts. The three rulers 
of the Roman world are Mark Antony, Octavius Caesar, and their weak tool, Lepidus. 
While Antony is idling away the days in Alexandria with Cleopatra, and giving 
audience to Eastern kings, in Italy things are all askew. His wife Fulvia has died. 
Pompey is in revolt with a strong force on the high seas. At last Antony is shamed 
home to Rome., Lepidus and other friends patch up a truce between him and 
Caesar, and it is cemented by Antony marrying Caesar's sister Octavia, to the boundless vexation of Cleopatra. What a contrast between the imperial Circe, self-willed, 
wanton, spell-weaving, and the sweet, gentle Octavia, wifely and loyal! From the 
time when Antony first met his "serpent of old Nile," in that rich Venetian barge 
of beaten gold, wafted by purple sails along the banks of the Cydnus, up to the fatal 
day of Actium, when in her great trireme she fled from Caesar's ships, and he shamefully fled after her, he was infatuated over her, and she led him to his death. After 
the great defeat at Actium, Enobarbus and other intimate followers deserted the 
waning fortunes of Antony. Yet once more he tried the fortune of battle, and on 
the first day was victorious, but on the second was defeated by sea and land. Being 
falsely told that Cleopatra is dead, Antony falls on his sword. Cleopatra has taken 
refuge in her monument, and she and her women draw up the dying lover to its 
top. But the monument is forced by Caesar's men, and the queen put under a 
guard. She has poisonous asps smuggled in a basket of figs, and applies one to her 
breast and another to her arm, and so dies, looking in death "like sleep," and 

    "As she would catch another Antony

  <summary author="Newman, John Henry (1801-1890)" title="Apologia Pro Vita Sua" print_title="Apologia\nPro Vita Sua">APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA, Cardinal Newman's famous justification of his 
religious career, was published in 1865. The occasion of his writing it was the 
accusation by Charles Kingsley that he had been, in all but the letter, a Romanist 
while preaching from the Anglican pulpit at Oxford. This accusation was incorporated in an article by Kingsley upon Queen Elizabeth, published in January, 
1864, in a magazine of wide circulation. In Newman's preface to his 'Apology' 
he quotes from this article a pivotal paragraph: "Truth, for its own sake, has never 
been a virtue with the Roman clergy. Father Newman informs us that it need 
not and on the whole ought not to be; that cunning is the weapon which heaven 
has given to the saints wherewith to withstand the brute male force of the wicked 
world, which marries and is given in marriage. Whether his notion be doctrinally 
correct or not, it is at least historically so." A correspondence ensued between 
Kingsley and Newman, which appeared later in the shape of a pamphlet. Kingsley 
replied in another pamphlet. Newman then deemed the time ripe for a full and 
searching justification of his position, and of the position of his brother clergy. 
The 'Apologia' appeared the next year. In it Newman endeavors to show that 
from his childhood his development was a natural, logical, instinctive progress 
toward the Catholic Church; that the laws of his nature, and not intellectual trickery or sophistry, led him to Rome. His reason was one with his heart, his heart 
with his reason. Yet he does not neglect the recital of the external influences 
which marked the changes in his religious life. For this reason the 'Apologia' 
casts remarkable light upon the religious England of the first half of the nineteenth 
century; and especially upon its concentrated expression, the Oxford movement. 
Its supreme value, however, is its intimate revelation of a luminous spirituality, 
of a personality of lofty refinement and beauty. </summary>

critics who had asserted that all the interest of his stories lay in the suspension 
of knowledge as to the denouement. The machinery is in full view, yet in spite of 
this disclosure, the reader's attention is held until he knows whether the villain or 
her victims will come out victorious. This villain is one Lydia Gwilt, who, as a girl 
of twelve, has forged a letter to deceive a father into letting his daughter throw 
herself away. Hateful and hideous as is her character, Lydia is so drawn as to 
exact a certain pity from the reader, by reason of her lonely childhood and her strong 
qualities. The few minor characters of the book, though distinct enough, do not 
detain the reader, eager to know the fate of poor Ozias, the hero, who is a lovable

(1870). The First South Carolina Volunteers was the first slave regiment mustered 
into the service of the United States during the late Civil War. It was viewed in 
the beginning more in the light of an experiment than as an actual factor in the 
war, and Colonel Higginson, who left a company of his own raising to take command, 
tells the story of this experiment in the form of a diary, the first entry being dated 
Camp Saxton, Beaufort, South Carolina, November 24th, 1862; the last, February 
29th, 1864. While the regiment did not engage in any great battles, it made many 
minor expeditions, was on picket duty, engaged in constructing forts, etc., all these 
duties being described in detail. The diary is valuable, in the first place, for the 
account of camp life, its privations and pleasures, work and recreation; secondly, 
for the description of the colored man as a soldier, and the amusing accounts of his 
peculiarities before freedom had made him "more like white men, less naive, less 
grotesque." Many quaint negro songs are given, and stories told in dialect. 
The diary displays great moderation and good taste, merits never absent from 
Colonel Higginson's work; and had it no other merit, it would be delightful 
reading, from its vivid description of Southern scenes and its atmosphere of 
Southern life. </summary>

twenty-six. It was the second of the delightful idyllic tales of Norwegian country 
life with which Bjornson began his literary career. It is a simple, beautiful story 
of the native life among the fiords and fells, with a charming love interest running 
through it. There is no intricacy of plot, and the charm and power come from the 
sympathetic insight into peasant character and the poetical way it is handled. 
Arne is a typical son of the region, sketched from his days of boyhood to his happy 
marriage. The portrayal of Margit, Arne's mother, is a pathetic and truthful one;

purple even melts around my flight/' ran the author's telegram at the moment of 
turning his face toward those islands where, as he afterwards wrote from Nikko, 
"everything exists for the painter's delight." And the telegram struck the keynote 
of the journey; for it is atmosphere even more than varied information, that renders 
these letters remarkable. The wonderful whiteness, the "silvery milkiness," of the 
atmosphere was the first "absorbingly new thing" that struck the painter when he 
landed at Yokohama. He erects a series of brilliant toriis or gateways (literally 
bird-perches of the gods), the reader getting the most exquisite glimpses of life and 
art in the ' ' land of inversion, ' ' where " art is a common possession. ' ' Like the shrines 
to which they lead, the letters are enriched with elaborate carving and delicate designs. But unlike the actual toriis, they do not of necessity point out any place, 
pleased rather with some tone "of meditation slipping in between the beauty coming 
and the beauty gone." Or they serve as a frame to a "torrent rushing down in a 
groove of granite" between "two rows of dark cryptomeria, " or a garden or a sunset: 
"a rosy bloom, pink as the clouds themselves, filled the entire air, near and far, 
toward the light." The idealist easily passes to the effect of the moral atmosphere. 
The whole drift of the book is toward a purer art; but it contains much lively matter, 
accounts of the butterfly dance in the temple of the Green Lotus, and of fishing 
with trained cormorants. A thread runs through the letters, tracing the character 
and progress of the usurping Tokugawa family, from the cradle of their fisherman 
ancestors to the graves of the great shogun and his grandson in the Holy Mountain of 
Nikko. In Nikko the interest culminates: there was written the chapter on Tao, 
serene as the peculiar philosophy it diffuses, and perhaps the best part of the book, 
which sets forth the most serious convictions on universal as well as Japanese art. 
Yet the letters were written without thought of publication or final gathering into 
this unique volume, with its various addenda and the "grass characters" of its 
dedicatory remarks peeping out irregularly, like the "lichens and mosses and small 
things of the forest" that "grow up to the very edges of the carvings and lacquers." </summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="As You Like It" print_title="As You Like It">AS YOU LIKE IT (1600). In this happiest of his middle-period comedies, Shakespeare is at no pains to avoid a tinge of the fantastical and ideal. Its realism lies in its 
gay riant feeling, the fresh woodland sentiment, the exhilaration of spirits that attend 
the escape from the artificialities of urban society. For one reason or another all the 
characters get exiled, and all meet in the Forest of Arden, where "as you like it" is 
the order of the day. There is the manly young Orlando, his villainous elder brother 
Oliver, and their servant Adam. At court is the reigning duke, his daughter Celia, 
her cousin Rosalind, and Touchstone the clown. In the forest, the banished elder 
duke (father of Rosalind) and the melancholy Jacques, and other lords who are 
blowzed with sun and wind a-chasing the dappled deer under the greenwood tree; 
the pealing bugle, the leaping arrow, the al fresco table loaded with the juicy roast 
of venison, and long idle summer hours of leisurely converse. On the outskirts of 
the forest are shepherd swains and lasses, old Conn, Silvius (in love with Phebe), 
and the wench Audrey. Orlando has had to fly from his murderous brother. Rosalind has been banished the court by her uncle, and she and Celia disguised as shepherd 
men have slipped away with Touchstone. Now Rosalind has been deeply smitten 
with Orlando since she saw him overcome the duke's wrestler, and he is equally in 
love with her. We may imagine her as "a nut-brown maid, tall, strong, rustically 
clad in rough forest garments, " and possessing a perennial flow of cheerful spirits, a 
humor of the freshest and kindliest. Touchstone is a fellow of twinkling eye and 
dry and caustic wit, his face as solemn as a churchyard while his hearers are all agrin. 
He and Jacques look at life with a cynical squint. Jacques is a blase libertine, who is 
pleased when things run counter and athwart with people, but is after all not so bad 
as he feigns to be. Like a series of dissolving views, scene after scene is glimpsed 
through the forest glades here the forester lords singing, and bearing the antlers 
of the stag; there lovesick Orlando carving verses on the bark of trees, or rescuing 
his brother from the lion. The youth Ganymede (really Rosalind) pretends she can 
cure Orlando of his lovesickness by teaching him to woo him as if he were Rosalind, 
all of which makes a pretty pastoral picture. Anon Touchstone passes by, leading by 
the hand the captive of his spear, Audrey, who has never heard of poetry; or in 
another part of the woodland he is busy mystifying and guying the shepherd Conn. 
Ganymede gets the heartless coquette Phebe to promise that if she ever refuses to 
wed him (with whom she is smitten) she will wed her scorned and despairing admirer 
Silvius, and makes her father promise to give Rosalind to Orlando; then retires and 
comes back in her own garments as Rosalind. The play ends with a fourfold marriage 
and a dance under the trees.</summary>

  <summary author="Chateaubriand, François Auguste de" title="Atala" print_title="Atala">ATALA, a romance of the American wilderness, by Chateaubriand, was published 
in 1801. In a letter in the Journal des DSbats, the preceding year, the author makes 
this reference to it: "In my work upon the 'Genius of Christianity, or the Beauties 
of the Christian Religion,' a certain portion is devoted exclusively to the poesy of 
Christianity; . . . the work is terminated by a story extracted from my 'Travels in 
America,' and written beneath the very huts of the savages. It is entitled 'Atala.'" 
'Atala' is an extravagant and artificial but beautiful romance of two lovers, a 
young Indian brave, Chactas (i.e., Choctaw), and an Indian maiden, Atala. Chateaubriand drew his conception of Chactas a savage, half civilized by contact with 
European culture from the tradition of an Indian chief, who, having been a galley-slave at Marseilles, was afterwards liberated and presented to Louis XIV. The 
pivot of the romance is the power of Christianity to subdue the wildest passions of 
man. Atala, a Christian, has taken the vow of virginity by the death-bed of her 
mother. Afterwards she finds herself in love with Chactas, who has been taken 
prisoner by her tribe. She aids him to escape, and together they roam through the 
pathless forests of the New World surrounded by luxuriant nature, haunted by the 
genius of the wilderness, the genius of productive life. Chactas would fain be one 
with nature in his abandonment to instinct; but Atala, although she is consumed with 
love for him, is obedient to what she believes to be a higher law. In a great tempest 
of lightning and rain they lose their way, being found and sheltered by a pious hermit, 
Father Aubrey, who takes them to his cave. Atala tells him the story of her vow, 
and of her temptation. He replies that she may be released, but his assurance comes 
too late. She has taken a poison, that she may become death's bride ere she has given 
herself to another. The hermit fills her last hours with the comfort of his ministrations, and she departs reconciled and soothed. Chactas carries her in his arms to the 
grave prepared by the hermit, the wind blowing her long hair back against his face. 
Together they leave her to her sleep in the wilderness. 'Atala,' despite its artificiality, retains its charm to this day. Chateaubriand's savages are Europeans, his 
forests are in Arcadia; nevertheless the narrative has a fascination which gives it a 
place among the fairy-tales of fiction, due not only to its charm of style but its 
noble elevation of thought. </summary>
  <summary author="Swinburne, Algernon Charles (1837-1909)" title="Atalanta in Calydon" print_title="Atalanta in Calydon">ATALANTA IN CALYDON, by Algernon Charles Swinburne (1865), is a tragedy 
dealing with a Greek theme, and employing the Greek chorus and semichorus in its 
amplification. To this chorus are given several songs, which exemplify the highest 
charms of Swinburne's verse, his inexhaustible wealth of imagery, and his flawless 
musical sense. The story is as follows: Althaea, the daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis, and wife to Ceneus, dreams that she has brought forth a burning brand. At 
the birth of her son Meleager come the three Fates to spin his thread of life, prophesying three things: that he should be powerful among men; that he should be most 
fortunate; and that his life should end when the brand, then burning in the fire, 
should be consumed. His mother plucks the burning brand from the hearth and 
keeps it; the child grows apace and becomes in due time a great warrior. But 
Artemis whose altars CEneus, King of Calydon, has neglected, grows wroth with 
him, and sends a wild boar to devastate his land, a beast which the mightiest hunters 
cannot slay. Finally all the warriors of Greece gather to rid GEneus of this plague. 
Among them comes the Arcadian Atalanta, a virgin priestess of Artemis, who for his 
love of her lets Meleager slay the boar; and he presents her the horns and hide. But 
his uncles, Toxeus and Plexippus, desire to keep the spoil in Calydon, and attempt 
to wrest it from Atalanta. In defending her, Meleager slays the two men. When 
Althaea hears that Meleager has slain her brothers for love of Atalanta, she throws 
the half-burned brand upon the fire, where it burns out, and with it his life. The 
feast becomes a funeral. Althaea dies of sorrow, but Meleager has preceded her; his 
last look being for the beautiful Atalanta, whose kiss he craves at parting, ere the 
night sets in, the night in which "shall no man gather fruit." </summary>
  <summary author="Hauptmann, Gerhart (1862-1946)" title="Atlantis" print_title="Atlantis">ATLANTIS, a novel by Gerhart Hauptmann (1912). A German physician, 
Frederick von Kammacher, is the victim of a morbid passion for a depraved young 
girl, Ingigerd, who has made a sensation on the stage in a dance which portrays the 
struggle and surrender of a spider's victim. He has recently placed his wife in an 
insane asylum; a scientific monograph he has written has been ridiculed by other 
scientists; and in the psycho-pathological state induced by depression, he is obsessed 
by Ingigerd 's fascination. He takes passage on the ship with her to America where 
she is to appear in vaudeville. The action takes place almost entirely on shipboard. 
It is a stormy passage, and they are shipwrecked in mid-ocean, possibly on a mountain peak of the lost Atlantis. The narration of events leading up to the wreck, 
the description of the wreck itself, and the struggle for the lifeboats is vivid realism. 
He saves Ingigerd and becomes her lover. In New York they meet theatre managers, 
and artists, and Ingigerd begins her professional career. Frederick escapes from her 
to a log cabin in the country, recovering from his obsession after an attack of brain 
fever. His wife dies, and he marries an artist whose sane, normal comradeship had 
helped him to free himself from Ingigerd 's toils; together the newly married pair 
return to Europe. The description of American personalities attracted attention 
because some of them seemed to be taken from the life during Hauptmann 's visit to 
this country in 1892, and the account of the shipwreck was notable as a kind of 
prophetic version of the loss of the Titanic, which followed in 1912. </summary>
  <summary author="Souvestre, Émile (1806-1854)" title="An Attic Philosopher in Paris" print_title="An Attic Philosopher\nin Paris">ATTIC PHILOSOPHER, AN ('Un Philosophe sous les Toits'), appeared in 1850. 
The author, Emile Souvestre, then forty-four, was already well known as a writer 
of stories; but this book was less a story than a collection of sympathetic moralizings 
upon life, "the commonplace adventures of an unknown thinker in those twelve 
hostelries of time called months. " He shows us one year in the life of a poor working-man who, watching brilliant Paris from his garret window, knows moments of envy, 
ambition, and loneliness. For these moods he finds a cure in kindness to others, in a 
recognition of his own limitations, and in a resolve to make the best of things. The 
voice is that of Souvestre himself, deducing from his own experience lessons of contentment, brotherly love, and simplicity. His character sketches include the frail 
and deformed Uncle Maurice, learning self-abnegation; the drunken Michael Arout, 
regenerated through love and care for his child; the kind and ever-youthful Frances 
and Madeleine, middle-aged workwomen, cheerful under all hardships; and many 
more vivid personalities. He excels in presenting the nobility hidden under common-place exteriors, and the pathos involved in commonplace conditions. In 1851 the 
French Academy crowned the 'Attic Philosopher'; and in 1854, after the death of 
Souvestre, it awarded his widow the Lambert prize, which is always bestowed upon 
the most useful author of the year. </summary>
  <summary author="Anonymous" title="Aucassin and Nicolette" print_title="Aucassin and Nicolette">AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE, a twelfth-century cante-fable, or tale in alternating 
prose and verse, composed by an unknown minstrel probably of the borders of Champagne and Picardy. Its subject, the idyllic love of a youthful pair separated by 
religion, birth, and romantic vicissitudes, bears a general resemblance to that of the 
lay of Floire et Blanche/or. The narrative medium, a simple prose giving way at 
intervals to seven-syllable verses with refrain, though unique in Old-French literature, is well known to students of the popular ballad and tale in various countries. 
The style has an apparently artless grace and a freshness suitable to the portrayal of 
young love; and there is a whole-souled almost pagan devotion to worldly beauty 
which anticipates the Italian Renaissance. Aucassin, son of the Count de Biaucaire, 
falls in love with Nicolette, a Saracen maiden, brought up a Christian in the home of 
his father's captain. On learning of Aucassin 's passion the Count orders the captain 
to remove her, and the latter shuts her up in his own house. Aucassin 's efforts to find 
Nicolette are frustrated by the captain, who warns the youth that a liaison with her 
would conduct him to Hell. At this Aucassin bursts out that Hell, the abode of fine 
knights and ladies and minstrels, would be preferable to Paradise, the home of beggars, 
priests, and monks. Later he does valiant service against his father's enemy, Count 
Bougars de Valence, on the promise of a short interview with Nicolette; and when the 
promise is broken, he releases the Count, whom he has made prisoner. For this act 
Aucassin is imprisoned in a tower. Through a crevice in the wall he is addressed 
by Nicolette, who has escaped by letting herself down from her window. As she is 
telling him of her resolution to flee the country and he is begging her to be true, they 
are interrupted by the arrival of the city guards. Nicolette manages to cross the wall 
and ditch and to escape to the neighboring woods. With some shepherd boys, who 
take her for a fay, she leaves a message for Aucassin and then constructs a bower of 
boughs and leaves, where she lives in hiding. Meanwhile her escape becomes known 
and Aucassin is released from prison. Riding through the forest he meets the shepherd boys, who inform him of Nicolette's presence there; and after a long search, and 
a meeting with a gigantic swain to whom he gives money to replace a lost ox, Aucassin 
reaches the bower. The meeting of the lovers is described in a strain of simple, 
idyllic beauty and is followed by an account of their journey to the land of Torelore, a 
topsy-turvy realm, where the king lies in child-bed and the queen goes out to a battle 
in which apples, eggs, and cheeses are used for missiles. Carried off in separate 
vessels by Saracens the lovers are brought to their respective countries. Aucassin 
finds his parents dead and rules in their place; Nicolette is restored to her father, the 
King of Carthage. When, however, he arranges a marriage for her she steals away 
disguised as a jongleur, reaches the palace of Aucassin, relates to him her own story 
in the form of a lay, and at last reveals herself. Their happy marriage ends 
the tale. 'Aucassin and Nicolette' was charmingly translated by Andrew Lang 
in 1887.</summary>

At this time he is paying his addresses to Mistress Evelyn Bird, a charming woman 
of wealth and position who really loves him, but hesitates about accepting 'his advances, fearing they may not be sincere. Hugon, a half-breed trader, whose attentions to Audrey are most distasteful to her, feels he has a rival in Haward and his 
plot to kill him is only prevented by the prompt action of Audrey and McLean, the 
storekeeper of Fairview. Haward and Audrey are much together and gossip is 
already rife, when the former, piqued by Evelyn's refusal to dance with him at the 
Governor's ball, in a fit of feverish bravado determines to make Audrey his partner 
at the Palace. In doing this he draws upon himself and upon her the anger of the

has been placed by Haward and her faith in him is destroyed. He has a long illness 
and upon his recovery endeavors to persuade Audrey that he loves her and wishes 
her to become his wife, but she eludes him and repulses him on every occasion. 
Audrey becomes an actress and her beauty and talents bring the world to her feet. 
Haward is unceasing in his efforts to win back her love and has just succeeded in 
doing so, when the blow of the assassin Hugon, which was intended for him, is intercepted by Audrey, who sacrifices her life for his.</summary>

talkative woman, who imagines it and puts it into words over the teacups to her 
young friend Lena Hough ton. "I assure you, my dear," she says, "Mr. Zaluski is

irreproachable character, has recently come to Muddleton, achieved an instant 
popularity in its society, and won the affections and promised hand of Gertrude 
Morley, one of the village belles. Miss Houghton repeats this slander to the young 
curate, who, jealous of the Pole's success, tells it to Mrs. Milton Cleave, his gossipy 
hostess, who writes it to a friend in London. It makes its next appearance at a 
dinner party, where, with the additions it has gained, it is related to a popular novelist. 
Struck with its dramatic possibilities, he repeats it to a friend at the Club, where it is 
overheard by an uncle of Gertrude, who writes to St. Petersburg to find out the truth. 
By this time, in addition to being a Nihilist, the young Pole is an atheist, an unprincipled man, besides being instrumental in the assassination of the Czar. The letter 
is found by the police; and Zaluski, returning to St. Petersburg on business, is 
arrested, and dies in a dungeon. The story is strongly told, its probabilities seeming

quotation of the author: "Of thy words unspoken thou art master: thy spoken word

but Holmes is far too good an artist to make them talk always the "patter" of their

dissimilar following each other, with anecdotes, witticisms, flowers of fact and fancy

of humanity more clearly shown. While there is no attempt to weave these essays 
into a romance, there is a suggestion of sentimental interest between the Autocrat

recently moved to the town and settled herself in a comfortable home, where she 
lives alone with her servants and holds herself aloof from the residents of Old Chester. 
She is known as a widow and her only visitor is Lloyd Pryor, who passes as her brother. 
This, however, is not the truth, as he is in reality Helena's lover and she in her desire 
for happiness blinds herself to her wrongdoing. She has been separated for thirteen 
years from her husband whom she despises, and expects in the event of his death to 
marry Pryor. He, however, is selfish and cruel and in spite of her intense love for 
him his affection for her has cooled. Helena adopts a small boy named David, who 
is brought to her notice by her two friends Dr. William King and Dr. Lavendar, and 
becomes passionately attached to him. She has an unsought admirer in Sam Wright, 
a village youth of artistic temperament, who shoots himself when lie learns her 
secret. This tragedy makes a deep impression on Helena and she decides to marry 
Pryor at once, as her husband has died at last, and she feels this act will restore her 
womanhood. However, Pryor is not at all anxious for this step, partly on account 
of his daughter Alice, a girl of nineteen, who is in completp ignorance of her father's

them takes David. Her plan is frustrated by Dr. King, who convinces her she

renounces David, and becomes so chastened that he restores the child to her

This "children's tragedy" is "one of the documents in a paper war which has 
resulted ... in having the physiology of sex taught in many of the German 
schools" (Translator's preface). The play is a frank but withal artistic presentation of the necessity of enlightening the child with regard to the problems of sex. 
In the story, two boys, the sensitive Moritz and the more assertive Melchior, speculate about sex, and Melchior promises to write out the physiological facts with 
drawings for his friend. Wendla, one of the group of school-children, questions her 
mother about her sister's new baby, but her mother evades the question, and seems 
interested only in the flounces to lengthen her growing daughter's dress. Later 
Wendla and Melchoir take refuge from a thundershower in the hayloft, and being, 
in the author's view, as innocent as mating birds and spring flowers are exposed to the 
dangers of their ignorance at this'critical period. The play is also an indictment of 
the cramming system of education. Moritz fails in his examinations and commits 
suicide. The paper Melchior had written for Moritz is judged by his parents and 
teachers to be a contributing cause to his suicide. One of the few touches of humor 
is the scene in which the faculty of the Gymnasium pass judgment on Melchior and 
spend the time quarreling over the opening and closing of a window. Melchior is not 
allowed to defend himself. In vain he says he has written nothing obscene. He is 
sent to a reformatory by his unintelligent parents. Wendla dies at fourteen in giving 
birth to a child, from the abortives given her to avoid a scandal. She says reproachfully, "Oh mother, why didn't you tell me everything?" and her mother replies: 
"My mother told me no more." In the last scene, Melchior, escaping from the 
reformatory, discovers Wendla's tombstone in the graveyard. Moritz appears carrying his head under his arm, and tries to induce Melchior to kill himself. A masked 
man, typifying the spirit of Life as Moritz symbolizes Death, urges Melchior to trust 
to him. The contest in the soul of Melchior is externalized in this duel between 
Life and Death, and Life wins him.</summary>

the thrilling adventures of a certain Professor Thomas Palgrave, Ph.D.; an archaeologist who goes to Mexico to discover, if possible, remains of the early Aztec civilization. The reader is hurried with breathless interest from incident to incident; and 
the mingling of intense pathos and real humor is characteristic of the author of 'The 
Uncle of an Angel ' and other charming books. Professor Palgrave, in company with 
Fray Antonio, a saintly Franciscan priest; Pablo, an Indian boy; and two Americans, 
Young, a freight agent, and Rayburn, an engineer, starts in search of the treasure-house of the early Aztecs. The professor goes to advance science; Fray Antonio to spread his faith; Pablo because he loves his master; and the rest for 
gold. What befell them in the search must be learned from the story. This 
volume, considered either as a piece of English or as a tale of adventure, deserves 
a high place.</summary>

volumes comprised in his 'Chronicles of Barsetshire.' The noteworthy success of 
'The Warden' led him to continue his studies of social life in the clerical circle centring at the episcopal palace of Barchester. He gives us a pleasant love story evolved

Bishop Proudie, his arrogant and sharp-tongued wife Mrs. Proudie, and Eleanor 
Bold, a typical, spirited, loving English girl. Trollope excels in showing the actuating 
motives, good and bad, of ordinary men and women. In a book as thoroughly

is extremely intricate. Barnaby is a poor half-witted lad, living in London toward 
the close of the eighteenth century, with his mother and his raven Grip. His father 
had been the steward of a country gentleman named Haredale, who was found 
murdered in his bed, while both his steward and his gardener had disappeared. The 
body of the steward, recognizable only by the clothes, is presently found in a pond. 
Barnaby is born the day after the double murder. Affectionate and usually docile, 
credulous and full of fantastic imaginings, a simpleton but faithful, he grows up to 
be liked and trusted. His mother having fled to London to escape a mysterious 
blackmailer, he becomes involved in the famous "No Popery" riots of Lord George 
Gordon in 1780, and is within an ace of perishing on the scaffold. The blackmailer, 
Mr. Haredale the brother and Emma the daughter of the murdered man, Emma's 
lover Edward Chester, and his father, are the chief figures of the nominal plot; but 
the real interest is not with them but with the side characters and the episodes. 
Some of the most whimsical and amusing of Dickens 's character-studies appear in 
the pages of the novel; while the whole episode of the gathering and march of the 
mob, and the storming of Newgate (quoted in the LIBRARY), is surpassed in dramatic 
intensity by no passage in modern fiction, unless it is by Dickens's own treatment 
of the French Revolution in the 'Tale of Two Cities.' Among the important characters, many of whom are the authors of sayings now proverbial, are Gabriel Varden, 
the cheerful and incorruptible old locksmith, father of the charming flirt Dolly 
Varden; Mrs. Varden, a type of the narrow-minded zealot; Miss Miggs, their servant, 
mean, treacherous, and self-seeking; Sim Tappertit, an apprentice, an admirable 
portrait of the half -fool, half -knave, so often found in the English servile classes about 
a century ago; Hugh the hostler and Dennis the hangman; and Grip the raven, who 
fills an important part in the story, and for whom Dickens himself named a favorite 
raven. </summary>
  <summary author="Motley, John Lothrop (1814-1877)" print_title="Life and Death\nof\nJohn of Barneveld " title="Life and Death of John of Barneveld ">BARNEVELD, JOHN OF, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF, by John Lothrop Motley 
(1874). In this brilliant biography, the author shows that as William the Silent is 
called the author of the independence of the Dutch Provinces, so John of Barneveld 
deserves the title of the "Founder of the Dutch Republic." The Advocate and 
Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province of Holland, the most powerful of the 
seven provinces of the Netherlands, was virtually "prime minister, president, 
attorney-general, finance minister, and minister of foreign affairs, of the whole republic." Standing in the background and veiled from public view behind "Their 
High Mightinesses, the States-General," the Advocate was really their spokesman, 
or practically the States-General themselves, in all important measures at home 
and abroad, during those years which intervened between the truce with Spain in 
1609 and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in 1618. 

Born in Amersfoort in 1547, of the ancient and knightly house of Oldenbarneveld, 
he received his education in the universities of Holland, France, Italy, and Germany, 
and became one of the first civilians of his time, the friend and trusted councilor of 
William the Silent, and the chief negotiator of the peace with Spain. The tragedy 
with which his lif e ended owes itself, as Motley points out, to the opposition between 
the principle of States-rights and religious freedom advocated by Barneveld, and that 
of the national and church supremacy maintained by Prince Maurice the Stadtholder, whose desire to be recognized as king had met with Barneveld's prompt 
opposition. The Arminian doctrine of free-will, as over against the Calvinists' 
principle of predestination, had led to religious divisions among the provinces; and 
Barneveld's bold defense of the freedom of individual belief resulted at length in his 
arrest and that of his companion and former pupil, Hugo Grotius, both of whom were 
condemned to execution. His son, engaging later in a conspiracy of revenge against 
the Stadtholder, was also with the other conspirators arrested and put to death. 

The historian obtained his materials largely from the Advocate's letters and other 
MS. archives of the Dutch government, and experienced no little difficulty in deciphering those papers "covered now with the satirical dust of centuries, written 
in the small, crabbed, exasperating characters which make Barneveld's handwriting 
almost cryptographic; but which were once, "sealed with the Great Seal of the 
haughty burgher aristocracy, documents which occupied the close attention of the 
cabinets of Christendom." 

Of Barneveld's place in history the author says: "He was a public man in the 
fullest sense of the word; and without his presence and influence the record of Holland, 
France, Britain, and Germany might have been essentially modified. The Republic 
was so integral a part of that system which divided Europe into two great hostile 
camps, according to creeds rather than frontiers, that the history of its foremost 
citizen touches at every point the general history of Christendom."</summary>

story in the New York Evangelist, was published in book form in 1872. Of a cheap 
edition, issued ten years later, 87,500 copies were sold. It was the author's first 
novel, and its great popularity led him to adopt story- writing as a profession. The 
plot of this book is very simple. Dennis Fleet finds the support of his mother and 
the younger children devolving upon him, after the death of his father. Seeking 
work in Chicago, he finds it impossible to secure a position suited to his social rank 
and education. After many hard experiences, he is hired to shovel snow in front of a 
fine-arts shop where he afterward becomes a porter. Though he cheerfully performs 
the humblest duties, his superiority to them is evident. His employer, Mr. Ludolph, 
a rich and money-loving German, finds him valuable enough to be made a salesman. 
Mr. Ludolph is a widower, having an only daughter, Christine, with whom Dennis 
falls in love. She treats him contemptuously at first, but soon discovers his trained 
talent for music and knowledge of art. He rises above the slights he receives, and 
makes the impression of a nobleman in disguise. Then follow an estrangement and 
a reconciliation. The most noteworthy feature of the novel is the striking description of the Chicago fire.</summary>

braggart and a blackleg, but of audacious courage and of picturesque versatility. 
He tells his story in a plain matter-of-fact way, without concealment or sophistication, glorying in episodes which would seem shameful to the most rudimentary 
conscience, and holding himself to be the best and greatest but most ill-used of men.

in the pit, box, and galleries. . . . Comedy is no more at present than a well-framed 
tale handsomely told as an agreeable vehicle for counsel or reproof." Farquhar's dramatic work is marked by rollicking spirits, good humor, manliness, and spontaneity. 
His last and best play, 'The Beaux' Strategem,' was written in six weeks during a 
"settled illness." Before he had finished the second act he knew that his malady 
was mortal, but he persevered and tried to be "consumedly lively to the end." 
Archer and Aimwell, two gentlemen of broken fortunes, disguised as master and 
servant, are a source of perpetual amusement. The innkeeper Boniface is an original 
creation which met with immediate success on the stage. Scrub, servant to the stupid 
and brutal Squire Sullen, is not only the ornament of the kitchen but a reliable 
repository for the secrets of the young ladies. Lady Bountiful, the "old civil

  <summary author="Gay, John (1685-1732)" title="The Beggar's Opera" print_title="The Beggar's Opera">BEGGAR'S OPERA, THE, by John Gay, was first played in 1728, exciting "a 
tempest of laughter." Dean Swift, upon whose suggestion this "Newgate pastoral" 
was written, declared that '"The Beggar's Opera* hath knocked down Gulliver." 
The object of the play was to satirize the predatory habits of "polite" society in 
thief-infested London, and incidentally to hold up to ridicule Italian opera. The 
chief characters are thieves and bandits. Captain Macheath, the hero, is the leader 
of a gang of highwaymen. A handsome, bold-faced ruffian, "game" to the last, he 
is loved by the ladies and feared by all but his friends with whom he shares his 
booty. Peachum is the "respectable" patron of the gang, and the receiver of stolen 
goods. Though eloquently indignant when his honor is impeached, he betrays his 
confederates from self-interest. Macheath is married to Polly Peachum, a pretty 
girl, who really loves her husband. She remains constant under many vicissitudes, 
despite the influence of her mother, whose recommendation to Polly to be " somewhat 
nice in her deviations from virtue" will sufficiently indicate her character. Having 
one wife does not deter Macheath from engaging to marry others, but his laxity 
causes him much trouble. Being betrayed, he is lodged in Newgate gaol. His escape, 
recapture, trial, condemnation to death, and reprieve, form the leading episodes in 
his dashing career. After his reprieve he makes tardy acknowledgment of Polly as 
his wife, and promises to remain constant to her for the future. Polly is one of the 
most interesting of dramatic characters, at least three actresses having attained 
matrimonial peerages through artistic interpretation of the part. Gay's language 
often confirms to the coarse taste and low standards of his time; and the opera, still 
occasionally sung, now appears in expurgated form. Its best-known piece is Macheath's famous song when two of his inamoratas beset him at once:

    "How happy could I be with either 
    Were t'other dear charmer away! "

and manner of this book, in the author's series of American History volumes, are 
Indicated in a few sentences of the preface: 

"In this sketch of the circumstances which attended the settlement of New
England, I have purposely omitted many details which in a formal history of that 
period would need to be included. It has been my aim to give the outline of such a 
narrative as to indicate the principles at work, in the history of New England down 
to the Revolution of 1689. ... In forming historical judgments, a great deal 
depends upon our perspective. Out of the very imperfect human nature which is so 
slowly and painfully casting off the original sin of its inheritance from primeval 
savagery, it is scarcely possible in any age to get a result which will look quite satisfactory to the man of a riper and more enlightened age. Fortunately we can learn 
something from the stumblings of our forefathers; and a good many things seem quite 
clear to us to-day, which two centuries ago were only beginning to be dimly discerned 
by a few of the keenest and boldest spirits. The faults of the Puritan theocracy, 
which found its most complete development in Massachusetts, are so glaring that 
it is idle to seek to palliate them or to explain them away. But if we would really 
understand what was going on in the Puritan world of the seventeenth century, and 
how a better state of things has grown out of it, we must endeavor to distinguish and 
define the elements of wholesome strength in that theocracy, no less than its elements 
of crudity and weakness." 

In the scientific spirit, which seeks the truth only and never the buttressing of 
any theory, yet with the largest liberality of judgment, the historian illustrates the 
upward trend of mankind from its earlier low estate. His philosophic bent appears 
most lucidly expressed in the first chapter, where the Roman idea of nation-making 
is contrasted with the English idea; the Roman conquest, with incorporation but 
without representation, with the English conquest, which always meant incorporation with representation. Then follow a description of the Puritan exodus, and the 
planting of New England, with comments on its larger meanings, a picture of the 
New England confederacy; the scenes of Zing Philip's lurid war, and the story of 
the tyranny of Andros, James the Second's despotic viceroy, which began the 
political troubles between the New England and the Old, that ended only with American independence. This volume, as will be inferred, is among the most interesting 
and suggestive of Mr. Fiske's many monographs. </summary>

quarters which were as Paradise to the neglected boy. Amid untidy surroundings 
Paragot reigns a king of philosophers instructing his pupil, whom he christens Anticot, in art, literature, and the humanities, and enlightening the frequenters of "The 
Lotus Club" with his droll wit and philosophic lore. Later, the pair set out for a 
tour of Europe and travel from place to place picking up general information and 
performing odd jobs. They fall in with Blanquette, a friendless country girl, and 
a stray dog, who are by Paragot annexed to his wandering household. Paragot for

the "Beloved Vagabond" and his early love Joanna, who has become Countess de 
Verneuil, and from whom he was separated by the treachery of the man she later 
married. She recognizes her old lover and during her husband's illness summons 
him to her aid. After the Count's death the truth regarding his treachery is revealed to the Countess who recalls the still adoring Paragot and renews their previous engagement believing that they can resume the old relations at the point 
where they were broken off thirteen years before. But the result is an absolute 
failure. Paragot gives up his Bohemian habits and tries to adapt himself to the 
conventional standard sweetly set by his adored Joanna; he dresses in prescribed 
garb and meekly endeavors to become as are the others in a placid English country town. Gradually the couple begin to realize that they have changed irrevocably

without a word and turns up in a state of blissful hilarity at a Bohemian resort in 
Paris, where he is captured and brought home to his old lodgings by his adopted 
son and the faithful Blanquette, who worships the ground he walks on. Paragot 
returns with rejoicing to his free and easy methods of existence and realizing the 
futility of restoring his old ideal world turns to that of commonplace reality; he 
marries the devoted Blanquette and goes to live on a small farm. Here the reader

Valerius Gratus, the new Roman governor, arrives in state, and the brother and 
sister go up on the roof to see the great procession pass, Judah accidentally dislodges 
a tile which fells the governor to the ground. Judah is accused of intended murder; 
his (till then) lifelong friend Messala, a Roman noble, accuses him of treasonable 
sentiments; his property is confiscated, and he is sent to the galleys for life. In the 
course of the narrative, which involves many exciting adventures of the hero, John

  <summary author="Anonymous" title="Beowulf" print_title="Beowulf">BEOWULF, an old English epic poem of unknown author and uncertain date, 
probably composed from earlier heroic lays, about 650 A.D., by a Christian poet, 
familiar with court life. As the scene and characters of the poem are entirely 
Scandinavian it is inferred that the material was brought over by the Angles when 
they settled in Britain or that the author obtained it by a visit to Scandinavia. 
Beowulf gives a representative picture of the courts of Germanic kings at a stage 
of society not dissimilar to the heroic age of Greece; and in its dignity, warlike ideals, 
and literary form is not incomparable to the Homeric poems. Each represents the 
point of development at which the rudely improvised lay of the bard is passing into 
the finished epic though in Beowulf the transition is less complete. Popular 
superstition is the basis of the story. Heorot, the palace of Hrothgar, King of the 
Danes, is visited nightly by a monster named Grendel, who devours the king's thanes 
as they sleep. Beowulf, the nephew of Hygelac, King o the Geats, a tribe in Southern Sweden (or, according to some scholars, the Jutes), comes across the sea with 
fourteen followers to free the Danes from this scourge. After a cordial welcome 
by Hrothgar and his court the visitors are left alone in the hall for the night. As 
they sleep, the monster Grendel enters, and devours one of the Geats. Though 
invulnerable to weapons Grendel is seized by Beowulf and held in a mighty grip 
from which he breaks away only with the loss of his arm, and flees to his cavern 
beneath a lake to die. Great are the rejoicings in Heorot. The minstrels sing 
heroic lays to honor Beowulf and the king loads him with gifts. But another 
monster, Grendel's mother, still lives and comes to the hall that night to avenge 
her son's death. The followers of Hrothgar are now sleeping there, and one of them, 
which, she carries off and devours. Beowulf pursues her to the depths of the 
gloomy lake, where she grapples with him and drags him into the cavern beneath 
the water. A desperate struggle ensues, in which after Beowulf's sword has failed 
and he has been flung to the ground and almost killed by her dagger, he slays the 
monster with an enchanted sword, found in the cavern. He then decapitates the 
lifeless Grendel and returns with his head to the shore. He is again thanked by 
Hrothgar, and after many ceremonious speeches returns to the palace of Hygelac, 
where his narration of his exploits gives occasion for another picture of court life. 
A long interval ensues, in the course of which Hygelac and his son Heardred are 
successively killed in battle, leaving the kingdom to Beowulf, who rules well for 
fifty years. Then a dragon with fiery breath devastates the kingdom. Beowulf 
with twelve followers' goes out to kill it. Sorely wounded and deserted by all his 
comrades but one, he finally slays the dragon, but at the cost of his own life. His 
body is burned by the Geats on a funeral pure and the ashes are enclosed in a barrow. 
The poem contains many references to other Scandinavian saga heroes, and at 
least one historical personage, Hygelac, who has been conclusively identified with a 
chieftain, Chochilaicus, who was slain during a raid upon the Franks and Frisians, 
about 515 A.D. Beowulf may also have been an actual person but has affiliations 
with the heroes of popular story and with certain Scandinavian deities. </summary>

Milan, 1825-26. Paris, 1827,' is the title of a book which, the author's only romance, 
sufficed to give him a European reputation. The purity and nobility of his life and 
the spiritual tojae of his writing make him the fit companion of his compatriot 
Mazzini in morals and politics. He wrote little, but all was from his heart and 
bespoke the real man. Skeptical in early life, and marrying a Protestant woman, 
she in restoring him to the Christian church herself became Roman Catholic, and 
their union was one of both heart and faith. It was under these influences, and 
amid the religious and political reaction which followed the death of Napoleon L, 
that Manzoni who had already become famous through his 'Sacred Hymns,' 
and his tragedies the 'Adelchi' and ' Carmagnola, ' both relating to remote periods 
of the past now produced a colossal romance which combined in one narrative 
a complete picture of Italian life. The scene of the story is laid within the country 
around Milan, and the plot concerns only the troubled and impeded but at last 
happily liberated course of true love between the humble peasant Renzo and his 
already betrothed Lucia, the village maiden, for whom Don Rodrigo, the chief of a 
band of outlaws, has laid his snares. On this simple scheme the author manages to 
introduce a graphic picture of the Italian robber-baron life, as represented by the 
outlawed but law-defying Don Rodrigo and his retainers; of various phases of the 
clerical and monastic life, as represented by the craven village curate Abbondio, 
the heroic priest Cristoforo, and the gentle and magnanimous Cardinal Borromeo; 
of a devastating plague in all its terrors and demoralizing power, as witnessed by 
the lover in searching the great city and the lazaretto for his beloved; of the "monatti," the horrible band of buriers of the dead; of the calming and restoring influence of the Church in bringing order out of tumult, the wicked to punishment, and 
virtue to its reward. The story is like a heritage of Boccaccio, Defoe, and Walter 
Scott, in a single superb panorama of which Salvator Rosa might have been the 
painter. The religious motive of the book is sincere but not exaggerated, and never 
runs to fanaticism. Its original publication was in three volumes, and occupied 
two years, 1825-26, during which time it awakened a wide interest in European 
circles; and having been soon translated into all modern languages, it has become 
probably the best known of all Italian romances to foreign readers.</summary>

country, but is deserted by her false protector who mistakes her for the Princess 
Yetive, and is left in a most dangerous position. She is rescued from this predicament by a band of goat-hunters, headed by a chief named Baldos, who also takes 
her for the princess but who protects her until she reaches her destination. Baldos, 
who has been seriously injured in saving Beverly from the attack of a wild beast, 
is put into a hospital by her, and while he is convalescing she persuades the princess to make him one of the palace guards. Beverly and Yetive conspire to keep 
up the illusion that the former is the princess of Graustark, but though they lay 
their plans very cleverly, Baldos sees through their deception. He does not let 
them know, however, that he has discovered the conspiracy and plays his part 
without committing himself. His manners and bearing, which are so far above his 
position, baffle the princess and her household and they endeavor to solve the 
mystery. Beverly finds herself becoming deeply in love with her unknown hero 
and after having tried in vain to conquer her feelings agrees to marry him and share 
his humble lot. After a series of thrilling adventures Gabriel is captured and the 
real identity of Baldos is revealed, as he acknowledges himself to be the dethroned 
Prince Dantan.</summary>
  <summary author="Lowell, James Russell (1819-1891)" title="The Biglow Papers" print_title="The Biglow Papers">BIGLOW PAPERS, THE, by James Russell Lowell, a series of political satire, 
in alternating prose and verse. The first series, relating to the war between the 
United States and Mexico, appeared in various journals from 1846 to 1848 and 
was published in the latter year in book form. Lowell believed the Mexican war 
a device of the Southern states to increase the extent of slave-holding territory and 
vehemently opposed it. For the expression of his views he created three typical 
Yankee characters: the Reverend Homer Wilbur, a New England country parson, 
scholar, and antiquarian, whose stilted and pedantic introductions to the verses serve 
as a medium for conveying Lowell's more serious moods; Hosea Biglow, a down-east farmer, whose shrewdness, common sense, and zeal for liberty find congenial 
expression in racy Yankee dialect both prose and verse; and Birdofredum Sawin, 
a rascally fellow- villager of Biglow's, who enlists for the Mexican war, becomes a 
convert to slavery and later to secession, and writes from the South epistles full of 
uproarious adventure and absurd arguments in favor of the cause he has adopted. 
This first series voices Lowell's hatred of a war which he considered un-Christian 
and of those Northern Whigs who supported it in order to gain political power. 
Few political invectives are more withering than Hosea Biglow's first poem, attacking the recruiting agents and the editorial supporters of the war; and the famous 
third poem, 'What Mr. Robinson Thinks, 1 with its stinging sarcasm and catchy metre, 
is not easily matched in the annals of satire. 'The Pious Editor's Creed' is worthy 
of Burns as an ironical presentation of hypocrisy. 'I du believe in Freedom's cause. 
, . . But libbaty's a kind of thing that don't agree with niggers. ' 

The second series of Biglow papers appeared in the Atlantic Monthly from 1862 
to 1866 and was published in book form in 1867. The Civil War had induced Lowell 
to revive the literary figures created in an earlier crisis, and he handles these characters with the old brilliance and power. Of particular interest are the comments 
of Wilbur and Biglow on the Trent Affair which constitute the second paper, entitled 
'Mason and Slidell: a Yankee Idyll/ In a dignified prose introduction, a vernacular dialogue in heroic couplets between Concord Bridge and Bunker Hill Monument (suggested by Burns's 'Brigs o' Ayr'), and a homely epistle from Jonathan 
to John, Lowell expresses his indignation at England's sympathy for the Confederacy, her supercilious attitude toward the North, and her resentment at an act 
of seizure similar to that which she had herself defended in 1812; he approves, however, the action of Lincoln in giving up the captured Confederate commissioners, 
and prophesies a future understanding between Great Britain and the Union. 
Birdofredum Sawin excites ridicule by his long epistles descriptive of his settlement 
and marriage in the South and his conversion to slavery and separation from the 
Union. Biglow's imaginary message to the Confederate Congress by Jefferson Davis 
illustrates the growing encouragement of the North at the weakening of Southern 
credit and morale. In the closing papers there are some attractive pictures of 
New England scenery and some fine prophecies of peace and reconstruction. The 
book is a brilliant and witty embodiment of the best abolitionist and unionist sentiment. The often ponderous but genuine and earnest zeal of the Reverend Homer 
Wilbur, the vigorous native wit and humor of Hosea Biglow, whose dialect, a spontaneous development of the race and soil, was deliberately chosen by Lowell as a 
source of life and freshness in diction, and the characteristically American exaggeration and caricature of Birdofredum Sawin are merely different phases of Lowell's 
attitude and temper. Many of the political allusions are obscure to the modem 
reader but the general drift of the satire is easy to follow and its effectiveness is 
unquestionable. </summary>
  <summary author="Ouida (1839-1908)" title="Bimbi: Stories for Children" print_title="Bimbi:\nStories for Children">BIMBI: STORIES FOR CHILDREN (1882). Ouida has done nothing so perfectly as her stories of child-life. In 'Bimbi' we see her at her best. The stories 
are simply but charmingly told, and show a wonderfully intimate sympathy with 
children. The characters are mostly little peasants, sweet, natural, and thoughtful, 
filled with a love of beauty and of old legends, and touched with the simple spontaneous heroism that is possible only to a child. 

'Hirschvogel,' which opens the volume, is the story of a German boy's romantic 
attachment for a beautiful porcelain stove, made by the great master Hirschvogel. 
August's father having sold the stove, the child secretes himself in it, and after a 
terrible journey of three days is found inside by the young king who has bought 
it; and who, pleased with the child's devotion, allows him to stay with his beloved 
Hirschvogel and receive an artist's education. 

'Moufflou' takes its name from a clever poodle, which Lolo, his little lame master, 
had taught to do many tricks. Lolo's mother having sold the dog while he was 
away, the child takes the loss so much to heart that he becomes ill, and is saved 
from death only by the opportune arrival of Moufflou, who has escaped and walked 
many miles to find his little master. 

Findelkind is a boy whose whole life is saddened because some twin lambs from 
his flock stray, and are frosen to death, while he is away upon a quest for money 
with which to found a monastery. 

The Little Earl who gives his name to the last story in the book learns early the 
lesson that "It is the title they give me and the money I have got that make people 
so good, to me. When I am only me you see what it is." 

'In the Apple Country' relates how a young Englishman receives into his home 
Gemma, a hot-tempered, warm-hearted little Italian girl, with her grandfather 
and brother, who have been arrested for strolling. And when Gemma has grown 
into a beautiful girl, impulsive still, but sweet and gentle, she consents to give up 
forever the grapes and oranges of Italy to live in the "Apple Country," as Philip 
Corey's wife. 

Perhaps the most charming of the stories is 'The Child of Urbino.' Two friends 
of the child Raf aelle Luca, a noble youth, and his sweetheart Pacifica, a gentle 
maiden are in great trouble. Pacifica's father, a great artist, has promised his 
daughter's hand to the painter winning in a contest to be decided by the duke, and 
Luca could paint but ill. On the day of the decision the duke and all present gaze 
in wonder upon one piece, which is found to be the work of the seven-year-old child 
Rafaelle. .Modestly and quietly the child claims Pacifica, takes her hand and 
places it in Luca's. They tell Luca that an angel has come down for him. "But 
Luca heard not: he was still kneeling at the feet of Rafaelle, where the world has 
knelt ever since."</summary>
  <summary author="Coleridge, Samuel Taylor (1772-1834)" title="Biographia Literaria" print_title="Biographia Literaria">BIOGRAPHIA LITERARIA, a loosely-knit series of chapters, autobiographical, 
philosophical, and critical, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, published in 1817. In the 
more philosophical chapters Coleridge explains his distinction between fancy and 
imagination and shows its relation to the views of Kant and other idealists. In 
chapters xiv. to xxii. he presents an extremely valuable examination and criticism 
of the poetical theories of Wordsworth as expressed in his Preface to the 'Lyrical 
Ballads' (1800). To the first edition of this famous collection Coleridge had contributed 'The Ancient Mariner.' He had been in close association with Wordsworth at the time when the book was planned and had discussed that plan with 
him. While warmly praising Wordsworth's power of investing common objects 
and scenes with an atmosphere of wonder he took exception to his dicta that the 
language of poetry should as far as possible be identical with that of common life 
and that there is no essential difference between the language of prose and that of 
poetry. He points out that poetry, being idealistic in its aims, must express concepts 
for which there are no words in ordinary conversation, that Wordsworth himself 
frequently uses in his poetry language utterly removed from that of humble, uneducated people, and that metre, by its emotional effect, differentiates poetry from 
prose. This admirable critique forms a salutary corrective to the excesses of 
Wordsworth's theory and brings out with sympathetic and appreciative insight 
the poetic beauties of his practice. It also enriched English criticism by some very 
important principles and judgments.</summary>
  <summary author="Michelet, Jules (1798-1874)" title="The Bird" print_title="The Bird">BIRD, THE ('L'Oiseau'), by Jules Michelet. In the year 1855 the eminent historian 
took up the study of natural science, as a relief from the too great strain of continued 
observation of the course of human events; and in three volumes, of which 'L'Oiseau' 
is one, he treated of non-human nature in a manner sympathetic and stimulating, 
but thoroughly imbued with his peculiar ethical and scientific theories. These 
works partook of the exceeding popularity which had met his studies in human history; and naturally, for they had all the charm of style, the grace and color and 
poetic feeling, which belonged to Michelet, together with the interest of an entirely 
novel attitude toward the subject presented. 

'L'Oiseau' is less a treatise on ornithology than a biography of the bird and, 
as a translator says, "an exposition of the attractiveness of natural history." It 
tells the story of bird-life in a delightful, somewhat discursive fashion, as the story 
of a being like ourselves. A hint of Pantheism, a suggestion of metempsychosis, 
a faint foreshadowing of Darwin, infuse the story of the birds as told by Michelet. 
Through it breathes a tender love for nature, a love which strove rather to establish 
a sympathy between man and his environment than to inform him concerning it. 
The author says that he shall try "to reveal the bird as soul, to show that it is a 
person. The bird, then, a single bird, that is all my book, but the bird in all the 
variations of its destiny, as it accommodates itself to the thousand vocations of 
winged life. . . . What are these? They are your brothers, embryo souls, 
souls especially set apart for certain functions of existence, candidates for the more 
widely harmonic life to which the human soul has attained." This conception colors 
the whole treatment of the subject. A translation, with illustrations by Giacomelli, 
was published in London and New York, 1869, three years after it first appeared 
in Paris.</summary>
  <summary author="Aristophanes (-450--388)" title="The Birds" print_title="The Birds">BIRDS, THE ('Aves'), by the Greek dramatist Aristophanes, is a comedy that 
appeared in 414 B.C. It belongs with the writer's earlier plays, in which farcical 
situations, exuberant imagination, and a linguistic revel are to be noted. The 
comedy is a burlesque on the national mythology: the author creates a cloudland 
for his fancy to sport in without restraint. A couple of old Athenians, Euelpides 
and Peisthetairos, sick of the quarrels and corruptions of the capital, decide to 
quit the country. They seek Epops, now called Tereus, who has become King of 
the Birds. He tells them so much about the bird kingdom that they are interested; 
and after a council of the birds, who, at first hostile, finally give the strangers 
a friendly reception, propose to build a walled city (Cloud-Cuckoo-Land) to 
shut out the gods and enhance bird power. This is done under Peisthetairos's 
supervision. Various messengers come from Athens and are summarily treated; 
a deputation from the gods also comes, offering peace, which is accepted on condition that the birds are reinstated in all their old-time rights. The comedy doses 
with the marriage hymn for Peisthetairos and Basileia, the beautiful daughter of 
Zeus. Throughout, the bird chorus sings lofty poetry, and the comedy parts are 
full of rollicking audacity of wit, much of it, however, so dependent upon local 
allusion or verbal play as to make it obscure for the English reader.</summary>
  <summary author="Holland, J. G. (Josiah Gilbert) (1819-1881)" title="Bitter-Sweet: A Poem" print_title="Bitter-Sweet:\nA Poem">BITTER-SWEET, by J. G. Holland, is a narrative didactic poem, of about three 
thousand five hundred lines, which appeared in 1858 and won great popularity.

Israel, a good old Puritan farmer, dwells in his ancestral New England home. 

    "His daughter Ruth orders the ancient house, 
    And fills her mother's place beside the board." 

On Thanksgiving eve the patriarch's children, with their families, gather for the 
festival. Round the hearth God's justice and providence and the mystery of evil 
are discussed. Israel stands for faith. Ruth expresses her doubts, having looked 
in vain for justice in the world. David, a poet, husband to Ruth's sister Grace, 
undertakes to teach Ruth that there is no incongruity in the existence of evil in a 
world created by beneficent design. His first illustration is drawn from nature, 
as David and Ruth seek the cellar to bring cider and apples for the, company, and 
is epitomized in the couplet: 

    "Hearts, like apples, are hard and sour, 
    Till crushed by Pain's resistless power," 

Grace, and Mary, a foster-daughter of the house, exchange the stories of their 
domestic sorrows, while each finds in the other consolation and sympathy. Grace 
tells of her husband's apparent interest in some unknown woman; but admits her 
griefs to be trivial beside those of Mary, whose dissolute husband has deserted her 
and their child. The question is next illustrated by story. Joseph, one of Israel's 
sons, tells to the children the old story of Bluebeard. The older folk find in it serious 
lessons in line with the main theme of the poem. Finally there is heard the cry of 
a man perishing in the storm which rages without. Brought to the fireside and 
revived, he proves to be the weak but now repentant Edward, husband to Mary. 
The injured wife forgives all, and discloses that the friend who has been comforting
her is the poet David. The revelation shows Grace that her jealousies have been 
groundless. Edward dies peacefully, and all see more clearly that God has not 
forgotten the world, and that there is 

    "In every evil a kind instrument 
    To chasten, elevate, correct, subdue."

  <summary author="Dickens, Charles (1812-1870)" title="Bleak House" print_title="Bleak House">BLEAK HOUSE. A novel by Charles Dickens (1853). One theme of this 
story is the monstrous injustice and even ruin that could be wrought by the delays in the old Court of Chancery, which defeated all the purposes of a court of 
justice; but the romance proper is unconnected with this. The scene is laid 
in England about the middle of last century. Lady Dedlock, a beautiful society 
woman, successfully hides a disgraceful secret. She has been engaged to a Captain 
Hawdon; but through circumstances beyond their control, they were unable to 
marry, and her infant she beHeves to have died at birth. Her sister, however, has 
brought up the child under the name of Esther Summerson. Esther becomes the 
ward of Mr. Jarndyce, of the famous chancery law case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, 
and Hves with him at Bleak House. Her unknown father, the Captain, dies poor 
and neglected in London. A veiled lady visits his grave at night; and this confirms 
a suspicion of Mr. Tulkinghorn, Sir Leicester Dedlock's lawyer, already roused by 
an act of Lady Dedlock. With the aid of a French maid he succeeds in unraveling 
the mystery, and determines to inform his friend and client Sir Leicester of his 
wife's youthful misconduct. On the night before this revelation is to be made, 
Mr. Tulkinghorn is murdered. Lady Dedlock is suspected of the crime, disappears, 
and after long search is found by Esther and a detective, lying dead at the gates 
of the graveyard where her lover is buried. The story is told partly in the third 
person, and partly as autobiography by Esther. Among the other characters are 
the irresponsible and impecunious Mr. Skimpole; Mrs. Jellyby, devoted to foreign 
missions; crazy Miss Flite; Grandfather Smallweed; Krook, the rag-and-bottle 
dealer; Mr. Guppy, who explains all his actions by the statement that "There are 
chords in the human mind"; the odiously benevolent Mrs. Pardiggle; Mr. Turvey-drop, the model of deportment; Mr. Chadband, whose name has become proverbial for a certain kind of loose-jointed pulpit exhortation; Caddy Jellyby, with inky 
fingers and spoiled temper, all of whom Dickens portrays in his most humorous 
manner; and, among the most touching of his children of the slums, the pathetic 
figure of poor Jo, the crossing-sweeper, who "don't know nothink." The story is 
long and complicated; but its clever satire, its delightful humor, and its ingrained 
pathos, make it one of Dickens's most popular novels.</summary>
  <summary author="Hawthorne, Nathaniel (1804-1864)" title="The Blithedale Romance" print_title="The Blithedale Romance">BLITHEDALE ROMANCE, THE, the third of Nathaniel Hawthorne's romances, 
published in 1852, was the outcome of an intimate acquaintance with the members 
of the Brook Farm Community; and immortalized the brief attempt of that little 
group of transcendentalists to realize equality and fraternity in labor. It is more 
objective and realistic than Hawthorne's other works, and therefore in a sense more 
ordinary. Its central figure is Zenobia, a beautiful, intellectual, passionate woman; 
drawn as to some outlines from Margaret Fuller. At the time it opens, she has 
taken up her abode at Blithedale Farm, the counterpart of Brook Farm. The 
other members of the community are Hollingsworth, a self-centred philanthropist; 
a Yankee fanner, Silas Forster, and his wife; Miles Coverdale, the relater of the 
story; and Priscilla, who is Zenobia's half-sister, though of this fact Zenobia is 
ignorant. 'The Blithedale Romance' is a brilliant instance of Hawthorne's power 
as a story-teller. No scene in the whole range of fiction is more realistic than the 
finding of Zenobia's body in the dead of night; drawn from the dank stream, a 
crooked, stiff shape, and carried to the farm-house where old women in nightcaps 
jabber over it. Nothing could be more in the manner of Hawthorne than his comment that if Zenobia could have foreseen her appearance after drowning, she would 
never have committed the act.</summary>
  <summary author="Browning, Robert (1812-1889)" title="A Blot in the 'Scutcheon" print_title="A Blot\nin the\n'Scutcheon">BLOT IN THE 'SCUTCHEON, A, a tragedy by Robert Browning, published 
in 1843 and acted in the same year. Mildred Tresham, only sister of Thorold, 
Earl Tresham, has been seduced by Henry, Earl Mertoun, whose lands adjoin those 
of her brother. Anxious to repair this wrong he formally requests her in marriage. 
Thorold, who knows nothing of his sister's fall, readily consents. But a retainer 
sees Mertoun climb to Mildred's chamber and informs his master, without being 
able to identify the intruder. Questioned by her brother, Mildred admits the truth 
of the story, but refuses to divulge her lover's name or to dismiss Earl Mertoun. 
Deeply wounded in his family pride, which is morbidly intense, Thorold is too emotionally stirred to infer that Mertoun and the lover are the same. Denouncing 
Mildred as a shameless woman he rushes into the park, where he wanders until 
midnight. Meanwhile, Mildred's cousin, Gwendolen, in a talk with Mildred, has 
divined the identity of Mertoun and the offender, and with her fianc6 and the earl's 
brother, Austin Tresham, goes out to find Thorold and to persuade him to forgiveness. They are too late, however. At midnight Thorold encounters Mertoun 
on his way to an interview with Mildred, and in his anger compelled him to fight a 
duel in which Mertoun, refusing to defend himself, is mortally wounded. Realizing 
at length his own harshness and injustice towards a boy who was penitent and 
eager to atone for his fault, Thorold exchanges forgiveness with Mertoun, and on 
his death, takes poison. He then goes to beg forgiveness of his sister who grants it 
and dies of a broken heart, closely followed by her brother. In dying he says that 
he leaves to Austin and Gwendolen an unblotted 'scutcheon. The catastrophe 
has been criticized as not inevitable and the speeches as too analytical for the stage, 
but there can be no doubt of the pathos and tragic power of this drama.</summary>

opening scene of this charming play the children of a woodcutter dream on Christmas eve that a fairy sends them on a quest for the blue bird of happiness for her 
little girl. Tyltyl, the boy, wears a green hat with a magic diamond in the cockade, 
which enables human beings to see like the fairies. At a turn of the diamond, the 
hours come dancing from the clock, and the souls of Light, Bread, Milk, the Dog, and 
the Cat awaken to accompany the children on their journey. They first visit their 
grandparents in the Land of Memory, where the dead return to life whenever we 
remember them. Then they search the caverns of the Palace of the Night for the 
blue bird, and see wonderful things. In the Kingdom of the Future, under the 
guardianship of Father Time, they see the unborn babies, with all sorts of things 
they are to bring to earth, crimes, inventions, and blessings for mankind. In the 
forest, the Cat warns the trees that the children of the woodcutter, their enemy, are 
in their power. The ivy binds the paws of the Dog, but he bursts his bonds to defend his master. At a turn of the magic diamond they find themselves back in the 
cottage, and the blue bird in their own cage at home. They give the bird to a neighbor to please her little girl who is sick, and it flies away. This fantasy paints the 
moral that happiness, though sought far away, and in the past or the future, can 
best be found close by in acts of unselfishness. The final flight of the blue bird out 
of the little girl's hand implies that happiness lies in the quest, not the possession.</summary>
  <summary author="Ollivant, Alfred (1874-1927)" title="Bob, Son of Battle" print_title="Bob,\nSon of Battle">BOB, SON OF BATTLE, by Alfred Ollivant (1898). It is the author's 
mission to be the inventor of the novelistic dog, for though horses have often 
figured in fiction, this is the first fully fledged novel with a dog for the central 
figure. The scene of the story is laid in the Cumberland fells and much of the 
interest turns on the trials of the sheep dog of the North. Bob or "Owd Bob," 
as he is called, is the last of the renowned "gray dogs of Kennion," a wonderfully 
fine and sagacious breed of shepherd dogs, in which the dalesmen took great pride. 
The deeds of this splendid creature and those of his rival, "Red Wull," the "Tailless 
Tyke," are set forth in a powerful manner. The dogs' contest for the "Champion 
Challenge Dale Cup" is described in a most spirited way, and the contrast in the 
characteristics of the two rivals is as great as that between their respective owners. 
Bob's master, James Moore, the farmer of Kenmuir, calm, firm, and gentle-hearted, 
one of a race of gallant "statesmen," is as widely distinguished from the blasphemous 
little Adam McAdams as is the noble gray dog from his sanguinary foe. McAdams's 
attachment to his dog, which is so much stronger than that which he feels for his 
own son, whom he treats with much cruelty, is set forth with remarkable strength. 
The search for the mysterious sheep slayer, and the capture of "Red Wullie," red-fanged and caught in the commission of the one capital crime of the sheep-dog, 
causes the breakdown of the culprit's master and reveals a bit of tenderness yet 
left in his hardened nature. Many of the episodes are eminently pathetic, especially so is the action of the "gray dog of Kenmuir" upon the tragic occasion of 
the downfall of his rival.</summary>

by Henri Murger (1848). Murger knew intimately the life of the penniless Parisian 
artists, musicians, and literary men who congregated in the Latin Quarter, and 
in this story has faithfully depicted it. Not possessed of genius or not yet recognized 
at their true worth they were unwilling to devote themselves to mere money-making 
tasks and therefore continued to strive for success in painting, the drama, poetry, 
or music. They endured cold and hunger, spent money freely and generously when 
they had it, and when it was gone were not above evading their tailors or landlords, 
upon whom as on the industrious bourgeoisie they looked down as Philistines. 
In this story we are introduced to a poet, Rodolphe; a painter, Marcel; a musician, 
Schaunard; and a philosopher, Colette. All have the same high artistic ambitions 
joined with impectmiosity; all employ the same tricks to deceive the bill-collector 
and the waiter. The story of Rodolphe's connection with Mimi and Marcel's 
with Musette, and of the delights, jealousies, separations, and reconciliations that 
ensued gives a certain unity to the book, which is, however, mainly episodic. The
pathetic death of Mimi closes the story, as it also forms the crisis of the drama, 
'La Vie de Boheme,' which Murger and Theodore Barriere staged in 1849. This 
play is the source of the libretto of Puccini's opera, 'La Boheme' (1898). Murger's 
tale and drama will live as a vivid record of a noted phase of literary life in the nineteenth century.</summary>

action and variety. Stephen Orry, a dissolute seaman, marries Rachael, the daughter of Iceland's Governor-General, and deserts her before their boy Jason is born. 
Twenty years later, at his mother's death-bed, Jason vows vengeance upon his 
father and his father's house. Orry, drifting to the Isle of Man, has married a 
low woman, and sunk to the depths of squalid shame. Finally the needs of 
their neglected boy, Sunlocks, arouse Orry to play the man; he reforms and 
saves some money. Sunlocks grows up like a son in the home of the Manx 
Governor, and wins the love of his daughter Greeba. The youth is sent to 
Iceland to school, and is commissioned by Orry to find Jason and give him 
his father's money a mission he is unable to fulfill. In trying to wreck, and 
then to save, an incoming vessel (which, unknown to Orry, is bearing the 
avenging Jason from Iceland to Man) Orry is fatally hurt; but is saved from 
drowning by Jason, who learns from the dying man's delirium that he has 
rescued the father and missed the brother whom he has sworn to kill. Throughout the story, 'his blind attempts at doing new wrongs to revenge the old are 
overruled' by Providence for good; and at the last, no longer against his will but 
by the development of his own nature, he fulfills his destiny of blessing those 
he has sworn to undo.</summary>

of the Acts and Monuments of the Church' was first published in Latin in 1554, 
when the author was in exile in Holland. The first English edition appeared in 
1563. By order of the Anglican Convocation meeting in 1571, the book was placed 
in the hall of every episcopal palace in England. Before Foxe's death in 1587 it 
had gone through four editions. 

This strange work kept its popularity for many years. The children of succeeding generations found it a fascinating story-book. Older persons read it for its 
noble English, and its quaint and interesting narrative. 

The scope of the 'Book of Martyrs' is extensive. The author calls the roll of 
the noble army from St. Stephen to John Rogers. From the persecutions of the 
early Church, he passes to those of the Waldenses and Albigenses, from these to 
the Inquisition, and from the Inquisition to the persecutions under English Mary. 
Foxe, as a low-churchman, was strongly prejudiced against everything that savored 
of Catholicism. His accounts are at times overdrawn and false. The value of the 
work, however, does not lie in its historical accuracy, nor in its scholarship; but 
rather in the fervent spirit which inspired its composition. 

He writes, in conclusion, of the unknown martyrs: "Ah, ye unknown band, 
your tears, your sighs, your faith, your agonies, your blood, your deaths, have 
helped to consecrate this sinful earth, and to add to its solemn originality as the 
battle-field of good and evil of Christ and Belial."</summary>

for the amusement of the groups of little ones he loved to gather around

deadthingsia, are full of wit; for pictures can be witty as well as words, 
and the drawings of the "nastikreechiakrorluppia,"the 'armchairia comfortabilis," 
and many other scientific curiosities, never pall. A grade beyond this in verbal 
accompaniment are the five-line stanzas after the manner of the "Old Man of Tobago," in 'Mother Goose': a few of these as that of the "young lady of Lucca, 
Whose lovers had all forsook her," and of the "old man who said, 'How shall I 
manage this terrible cow?' " rank as familiar quotations, but he has been so 
greatly surpassed by others in this line that they can hardly be thought his best. The 
"Nonsense Cookery," in one recipe of which we are told to "serve up in a clean 
table-cloth or dinner napkin, and throw the whole mess out of window as fast as 
possible"; and the voyage around the world of the four children, who are looked on 
by their elders with "affection mingled with contempt," add each their quota of 
good things. But unquestionably his highest level is reached in the famous ballads, such as 'The Jumblies,' who "went to sea in a sieve," and reached "the lakes, 
and the Torrible Zone, and the hills of the Chankly Bore"; the Pelican Song, with 
some really lovely poetry in it, and its inimitable nonsense refrain; 'The Owl and 
the Pussy Cat'; 'The Pobble who Has No Toes'; 'The Yonghy Bonghy Bo'; 'The 
Quangle Wangle Quee'; 'The Old Man from the Kingdom of Tess'; 'The Two Old 
Bachelors'; and others, all together making up a melange of buoyant fun which

  <summary author="Thackeray, William Makepeace (1811-1863)" title="The Book of Snobs" print_title="The Book of Snobs">BOOK OF SNOBS, THE, a series of sketches by William Makepeace Thackeray, 
appeared first in Punch, and was published in book form in 1848. The idea of the 
work may have been suggested to Thackeray when, as an undergraduate at Cambridge in 1829, he contributed to a little weekly periodical called The Snob. In 
any case, the genus Snob could not long have escaped the satirical notice of the 
author of 'Vanity Fair.' He was in close contact with a social system that was 
the very nursery of snobbishness. In his delightful category, he omits no type of 
the English-bred Snob of the university, of the court, of the town, of the country, 
of the Church; he even includes himself, when on one occasion lie severed his friendship for a man who ate peas with a knife, an exhibition of snobbery he repented 
of later, when the offender had discovered the genteel uses of the fork. The half-careless, half -cynical humor of it all becomes serious in the last paragraph of the 
last paper: 

"I am sick of court circulars. I loathe haut-ton intelligence. I believe such 
words as Fashionable, Exclusive, Aristocratic, and the like, to be wicked unchristian 
epithets that ought to be banished from honest vocabularies. A court system that 
sends men of genius to the second table, I hold to be a Snobbish System. A society 
that sets up to be polite, and ignores Art and Letters, I hold to be a Snobbish Society, 
You who despise your neighbor are a Snob; you who forget your friends, meanly 
to follow after those of a higher degree, are a Snob; you who are ashamed of your 
poverty and blush for your calling, are a Snob; as are you who boast of your pedgree or are proud of your wealth." </summary>

Custer (1885). The author says that her object in writing this book, 
which records her experiences in garrison and camp with her husband, was to give 
civilians a glimpse of the real existence of soldiers in the field. Her married life 
was not serene: she was left in 186.4 in a lonely Virginia farmhouse to finish her 
honeymoon alone, her husband being summoned to the front; and at scarcely any 
time during the next twelve years was she free from fear of immediate or threatened 
peril. General Custer was ordered to Dakota in the spring of 1873. Mrs. Ouster's 
book gives a lively and detailed account of their life there from 1873 to 1876, the 
time of the general's death. All those little details the household habits and 
changes, the packings and movings, the servants' remarks, the costumes, the weather, 
the frolics and the feasts that are so much to women, and the absence of which 
makes the picture so dim, here appear. The regimental balls, the pack of hounds, 
her husband's habits and looks and horsemanship, the coyotes, the sleigh-rides, 
the carrying of the mail, the burning of the officers' quarters, the curious characters 
and excursionists, the perplexities and pleasures of army domestic life, the Indians, 
the gossip, the ins and outs of army etiquette, the deserters, the practical jokes, 
are duly described. Her sketch of thirty-six hours spent in a cabin during a Dakota 
blizzard, with no fire, the general sick in bed and requiring her attention, the wind 
shrieking outside and at times bursting in the door, the air outdoors almost solid 
with snow that penetrated the smallest cracks and collected on the counterpane, 
and (to help matters) a party of bewildered soldiers, some of them partially frozen, 
claiming her hospitality and care, is very graphic. 

There is an interesting chapter on General Ouster's literary habits, and an 
appendix containing extracts from his letters. Captain King has described army 
life in the West from the masculine side; such a book as this paints it from the 
feminine.</summary>
  <summary author="Pushkin, Aleksandr Sergeevich (1799-1837)" print_title="Boris Godunov:\na drama in verse" title="Boris Godunov: a drama in verse">BORIS GODOUNOFF, an historical drama, mainly in blank verse, written 
by Alexander Sergyeevitch Pushkin, in 1826 and first acted in 1831. Inspired by the 
chronicle-histories of Shakespeare, Pushkin chose for his theme the troubled period 
of Russian history that followed the death of Czar Theodore, the son of Ivan the 
Terrible, in 1598. The play begins at Moscow, where conversations of the nobles 
and the people show the dangerous condition of the realm. Theodore has died 
without an heir, his younger brother, Dimitry, having been assassinated in 1591. 
Although suspected of having ordered the death of Dimitry, the late czar's brother-in-law, Boris Godounoff, is felt to be the strongest man in Russia and is urged by 
nobles and people to accept the crown. After some show of resistance he complies. 
The scenes now shift to the year 1603. In the monastery of Tchudoff is a young 
monk, Gregory Otrepieff, of a noble Galician family. Restless and ambitious he 
listens with delight to the stories of an old monk who tells him of the exploits of 
Ivan and Theodore and the murder of Dimitry, which he knows to have been ordered by Boris. Learning that he and the murdered prince would have been of 
the same age, Gregory resolves to pass himself off as Dimitry, saved from death. 
He escapes from the monastery, by cleverness and address evades the guards who 
have overtaken him at a tavern, and gets across the border into Lithuania. News 
soon comes that he has proclaimed himself as Dimitry and that the Polish king and 
people have accepted him and are preparing an invasion to seat him on the throne. 
The Russians are profoundly stirred by the intelligence, though restrained by the 
stem measures of Czar Boris. Meanwhile Gregory, the false Dimitry, delays his 
attack, while he makes love to the beautiful Marina, daughter of the Polish voyevod, 
Mnichek. In a powerful scene with her he admits that he is an impostor, not enduring to receive her love in another's name. At first she overwhelms him with scorn 
and contempt; but when he says defiantly that he is the czarevitch in spirit, that 
whether the Poles believe him to be the true or false Dimitry they will follow him as 
a pretext of war, and that he will prove himself worthy in spite of her scorn, she 
admires his manliness and promises that if he conquers Boris and makes himself 
czar she will many him. We are then shown a number of battle and counsel scenes 
as the invaders enter Russia and Boris takes measures against them. A preliminary victory for the false Dimitry is followed by his defeat by superior numbers. 
He retires, however, and raises a new army, stirred up by the belief that he is Dimitry. 
At this juncture Czar Boris suddenly dies, giving to his son advice which resembles 
that of Henry IV. to Prince Hal. The young Theodore has no opportunity to follow it, however. An ambassador from Dimitry soon urges the people to an uprising; 
and the new czar with his sister Xenia is killed in prison. The play is a mere succession of historical tableaux without division into acts and without any well-marked 
structure. The style has the simple directness of the old chronicles from which 
the story is drawn. The incidents are represented with historic faithfulness and 
dramatic force. The opera by Moussorgsky founded on this drama was given in 
St. Petersburg in 1874, and in a first performance in New York in 1913. </summary>

He becomes obnoxious to the Council, and a bravo is set on his track to kill him. 
He has fallen in love with Violetta, a young orphan heiress designed for the son

Jacopo, the Bravo, finds her in prison, and contrives her escape to her husband;

in a Western city. Maud's head is turned by Farnham's kindness, and she boldly 
confesses her love to him which is not reciprocated. Maud's rejected lover, 
Sam Sleeny, an honest but ignorant journeyman in Matchin's employ, is jealous of 
Farnham. He is dominated by Offitt, a vicious demagogue, and joins a labor-reform 
organization. Farnham loves his beautiful neighbor Alice Belding. She refuses his 
addresses, but soon discovers that her heart is really his. During a riotous labor
strike (described at length), Farnham organizes a band of volunteer patrolmen for the 
protection of life and property. His own house is attacked by the mob, and Sleeny 
assaults its owner with a hammer; but failing to kill him, threatens future vengeance. 
OfHtt now pays his addresses to Maud, who intimates that she desires to see Farnham suffer for his affront to her. Offitt stealthily enters Famham's home, strikes 
him with a hammer borrowed from Sleeny, and makes off with a large sum of money 
just as Alice and Mrs. Belding arrive in time to care for Farnham's serious hurts. 
Offitt dexterously directs suspicion to Sleeny, who is arrested. The real culprit 
hastens to Maud, and urges her to fly with him. Suspecting the truth, she refuses, 
and wheedles from Offitt his secret, which she at once reveals. In the meanwhile, 
Sleeny breaks jail and flies to Maud's home. Here he meets Offitt, and kills him for 
his perfidy. Sleeny is at once cleared of the charge of assaulting Farnham, but is 
tried for the killing of Offitt and acquitted upon the ground of temporary insanity. 
The novel is brilliantly written, and its presentation of the conditions of labor is 
very graphic.</summary>

directly told. There is little descriptive work in it, the characters are few and distinct, and the story is developed naturally. 

Sir James and Lady Bligh, at home in England, are startled by the news from 
their elder son, Alfred, that he is bringing home a "bride from the bush," to his 
father's house. The bride arrives, and drives to distraction her husband's conventional family, by her outrages upon conventional propriety. Gladys tries hard to 
improve; but after an outbreak more flagrant than usual, she runs away home to 
Australia, because she has overheard a conversation which implies that her husband's 
prospects will be brighter without her, and that he has ceased to love her. Alfred, 
broken-hearted at her disappearance, and apprehensive for a time that she has 
drowned herself, breaks down completely; and as soon as he is partially recovered, 
he goes out to Australia to find her. On the way to her father's "run," he takes 
shelter from a sand-storm in the hut of the "boundary rider," finds a picture of 
himself on the pillow, and surmises the truth,' of which he is assured a few moments 
later, when Gladys, the "boundary rider," comes galloping in. Explanations follow; 
and the reunited couple decide to remain in Australia, and never to return "home" 
except for an occasional visit. The book is full of a spirit of adventure, and a keen 
sense of humor, which give value to a somewhat slight performance. </summary>

group of 'Waverley Novels' called 'Tales of my Landlord.' The plot was suggested 
by an incident in the family history of the earls of Stair. The scene is laid on the 
east coast of Scotland, in the year 1700. The hero is Edgar, Master of Ravens wood, 
a young man of noble family, penniless and proud. He has vowed vengeance against 
the present owner of the Ravenswood estates, Sir William Ashton, Lord Keeper, 
whom he considers guilty of fraud; but foregoes his plans on falling in love with Lucy, 
Sir William's daughter. There is a secret betrothal; the ambitious Lady Ashton

leaving "him his fortune if he marries Lady Sophia Sefton within the year, otherwise 
he is cut off with a legacy of ten guineas. Peter, being independent in spirit, declines

adventures, is soon robbed of his money and left penniless. Being skilled in wrestling, 
Peter is victorious on many occasions when he is called upon to show his prowess, and 
bearing a striking resemblance to his dissolute cousin Maurice Vibart, who is a 
famous fighter, he is frequently taken for him. A great lover of nature, as well as a 
scholar, Peter thoroughly enjoys his wandering existence and decides to try his hand 
at the trade of blacksmith, meanwhile, taking up his habitation in a deserted hut in 
a hollow in the woods. One night he is awakened by the bursting in of his door and

sought Peter's hut as refuge. Finding Peter much injured by his encounter, Charmian binds up his wounds and ministers to his comfort. Wishing to hide herself and 
finding Peter a thorough gentleman, Charmian remains at the hut, cooks his meals, 
and makes an ideal home for him. Peter, of course, falls in love with his charming 
companion and they decide to go to the minister's house to be married. On their 
return Peter is called to the bedside of a dying friend and during his absence Maurice 
Vibart is mysteriously shot outside of his house. Peter suspects Charmian, who tells 
him she only shot her pistol in the air, and lets himself be arrested for the murder.

material to the romantic story of the Brontes." This material was furnished partly 
by the Rev. Arthur Bell Nicholls, Charlotte's husband, and partly by her lifelong

"Christ myth" is the theme of an historical novel, the life of Jesus. The first part
of the book is the story of Joseph of Arimathea, the son of the rich merchant. The 
setting is the little Galilean village on the lake, the picture of the period, and the 
customs of Jewish family life, and primitive sects like the Essenes. Joseph becomes 
interested in Jesus, the shepherd, who has left his flocks to foretell the end of the 
world. Peter, James, and John, fishermen in his father's employ, become disciples of 
Jesus, and Joseph would also follow him but for his father's illness and his promise 
not to leave him. He does not see Jesus again until he finds him crucified on the 
cross in Jerusalem. Joseph asks his friend Pilate for permission to remove the body 
for burial, and takes Jems to his own tomb. After the holy women, Alary and 
Marcha, have left the tomb, Joseph discovers that Jesus is still living, and carries 
him home in the night and hides him in the empty gardener's cottage. Joseph listens 
to the tales of the resurrection without comment. As soon as Jesus recovers from his 
wounds, Joseph goes with him to the Essenes by the Brook Kerith, where Jesus had 
lived before his ministry, as the humble shepherd of the community. For thirty 
years Jesus tends the flocks. He comes to admit to himself that he committed a 
great sin of blasphemy against God when he believed he was the Messiah prophesied 
by the Book of Daniel. He repents the violence of his teachings in Jerusalem. 
Paid, persecuted for preaching Christianity, takes refuge one night with the brethren. 
Jesus asks him, "And who are these Christians?" Paul tells him the story of the 
resurrection and the mediation of the Son, dying on the cross for the sins of the world. 
Jesus is horrified at the supernatural Christianity of Paul's imagination, and resolves 
to go to Jerusalem and tell the truth. Paul considers him a mad man and impostor, 
and Jesus is forced to see that his story will not be believed. In accordance with one 
of the old legends it is suggested that Jesus goes to preach in India. Moore's conception of Jesus is two-fold, the spiritual leader of the Sermon on the Mount, the 
fanatic, misled by pride of the scourging in the Temple, and always one of the great 
men of the ages.</summary>
  <summary author="Layamon" title="Layamon's Brut" print_title="Layamon's Brut">BRUT, THE, a metrical chronicle of early British history, both fabulous and authentic, and the chief monument of Transitional Old English, first appeared not long 
after the year 1200. Its author Layamon, the son of Leovenath, was a priest, residing 
at Ernley on the banks of the Severn in Worcestershire. His work is the first MS. 
record of a poem written after the Conquest in the tongue of the people. The Norman-French influences had scarcely penetrated to the region where he lived. On 
the other hand, the inhabitants were in close proximity to the Welsh. The additions 
that Layamon made to the 'Brut' show how deeply the Arthurian legends had sunk 
into the minds of the people. 

The 'Brut' is a translation, with many additions, of the French 'Brut d'Angleterre' of Wace, which in its turn is a translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's 'Historia 
Britonum.' Layamon's version begins thus: 

"There was a priest in the land Who was named Layamon. He was son of 
Leovenath, May the Lord be gracious to him ! He dwelt at Ernley, at a noble 
church Upon Severn's bank. Good it seemed to him, Near Radstone, Where he 
read book. It came to him in mind, And in his chief thought That he would of 
England Tell the noble deeds. What the men were named, and whence they came, 
Who English land First had, After the flood That came from the Lord That destroyed all here That is found alive Except Noah and Sem Japhet and Cane And 
their four wives That were with them in the Ark. Layamon began the Journey Wide 
over this land, And procured the noble books Which he took for pattern. He took 
the English book that Saint Bede made, Another he took, in Latin, That Saint Albin 
made, And the fair Austin Who brought baptism in hither; the third book he took, 
Laid there in the midst, That a French clerk made, Who was named Wace, Who well 
could write, and he gave it to the noble Eleanor that was Henry's Queen, the high 
King's. Layamon laid down these books and turned the leaves. He beheld them 
lovingly." 

The 'Brut' contains, however, few traces of Bede's chronicle. It follows Wace 
closely, but amplifies his work and adds to it. Some of the additions are concerned 
with the legendary Arthur. Layamon's most poetical work is found in them. The 
beautiful legends of the great king seem to have appealed powerfully to his imagination and to his sympathies as a poet. He makes Arthur say in his dying speech: 

"I will fare to Avalun, to the fairest of all maidens, to Argante the Queen, an elf 
most fair, and She shall make my wounds all sound; make me all whole with healing 
draughts. And afterwards I will come again to my kingdom, and dwell with the 
Britons with Mickle Joy."</summary>
  <summary author="Wace" title="Arthurian Chronicles: Roman de Brut" print_title="Roman de Brut">BRUT, ROMAN DE. A poem in eight-syllable verse, composed by Robert Wace, 
but indirectly modeled upon a legendary chronicle of Brittany entitled 'Brut y 
Brenhined' (Brutus of Brittany), which it seems was discovered in Armorica by 
Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, and translated into Latin by Geoffrey of Monmouth. 
This translation is declared to have been the source from which Wace drew his 
materials. He presented his poem to Eleonore of Guyenne in 1155, and it was 
translated into Anglo-Saxon by Layamon. 

The 'Roman de Brut' relates that after the capture of Troy by the Greeks, 
^Eneas came to Italy with his son Ascanius, and espoused Lavinia, daughter of King 
Latinus; she duly presented a son to him. This son, as well as Ascanius, succeeded 
to the kingly power; and the throne devolved at last upon Silvius, son of Ascanius. 
Silvius fell in love with a damsel who died upon giving birth to Brutus, from whom the 
'Roman de Brut' takes its name. Brutus was a mighty hunter. One day he had 
the misfortune to slay his father with a misdirected arrow aimed at a stag, and 
forthwith he fled. First he went to Greece, where he delivered the Trojan captives; 
and next he gained the Armorican Isles, which he conquered, giving them the name 
of Britain. Afterward he made war upon the king of Poitou, founding the city of 
Tours, which he named in honor of his son. From Poitou he returned to the Armorican Isles, overcoming the giants in possession of that region, and once more 
naming it Britain. He immediately founded the city of London, and reigned long 
and gloriously there. 

The narrative now concerns itself with the descendants of Brutus. The adventures of Lear, of Belin, of Brennus who voyaged to Italy, of Cassivellaunus who so 
bravely resisted Cassar, of all the bellicose chiefs who opposed the dominion of the 
Roman emperors, are minutely related. But not until King Arthur is introduced 
do we meet the real hero of the 'Roman de Brut' Arthur performs prodigies of 
valor, is the ideal knight of his order of the Round Table, and finally departs for some 
unknown region, where it is implied he becomes immortal, and never desists from the 
performance of deeds of valor. In this portion of the narrative figure the enchanter 
Merlin, bard to King Arthur; the Holy Grail, or chalice in which were caught the 
last drops of the Savior's blood as he was taken from the cross; Lancelot of the Lake, 
so styled from the place in which he was trained to arms; Tristan and his unhallowed 
love; Perceval and his quest of the Holy Grail. These and other features of the 
'Roman de Brut' made it unprecedentedly popular. It was publicly read at the 
court of the Norman kings, that the young knights might be filled with emulation; 
while fair ladies recited it at the bedside of wounded cavaliers, in order that their 
pain might be assuaged.</summary>

work of men. This type Miss Tarbell calls 'The Uneasy Woman' because of its 
restlessness, dissatisfaction, and unsettled state. Miss Tarbell is no enemy to the 
extension of woman's opportunities for education and employment but she is conservative enough to hold that the main business of being a woman is still that of 
motherhood and the making of the home. She proceeds to show that these tasks, 
far from being narrow, tedious, and unworthy of an emancipated being, are of the 
noblest, the most absorbing, and the most rewarding kind, requiring all the added
culture and power which woman's freedom has bestowed. The mere efficient 
management of the household requires an economic knowledge and a practical ability equal to that of the business man. The moral training of the children is 
problem worthy of the highest energies. The proper training of domestic servants, 
usually foreigners, would do much to make them useful citizens, and thus 
promote democracy in the most practical way. Above all, the woman's business 
is noble because it is not merely material and mechanical but consists in the 
creation of a spirit that makes home a happy social centre. By these and other 
shrewd and practical arguments the author successfully combats the view that 
"celibacy is the aristocracy of the future" and makes her work a material contribution to the subject of her last chapter, "the ennobling of the woman's 
business." </summary>

tragedies, first appeared in 1607 and was republished in 1608, 1616, 1641, 1657. 
The scene is set in the Court of Henry III. of France, who with his brother, Monsieur 
the Duke of Alencon, and the Duke of Guise, the head of the Spanish party in the 
French Wars of Religion, takes part in the action of the play. Bussy d'Ambois, of 
noble birth, but a child of fortune who has to depend on his valor and his character, 
is introduced to the Court by Monsieur whose purpose it is to use him as a tool to 
smooth his own path to the throne. But Bussy raises himself to a position of power 
and independence, and Monsieur and Guise, whom he has flaunted, combine to 
compass his destruction. This they attempt to accomplish by revealing to the 
Count of Mountsurry Bussy's passion for the Countess Tamyra, whom he used to 
visit by a subterranean passage known only to himself and a friar who had acted as 
his guide. The friar is killed and his ghost warns the lovers of his fate and their 
danger. Bussy is deceived by a letter which the Countess had been compelled by 
her husband to write in her blood, and going to meet her for the last time is confronted by the Count in the habit of the friar. Although he defeats his immediate 
adversary, he is shot by the hireling assassins of his other foes. The character of 
Bussy is powerfully drawn, but the other figures are bloodless and the style often 
degenerates into bombast.</summary>
  <summary author="Shaw, Bernard (1856-1950)" title="Caesar and Cleopatra" print_title="Caesar and Cleopatra">CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, by Bernard Shaw (1899). In aai amusing preface to 
'Three Plays for Puritans' the author claims that the Caesar of Shakespeare is an 
"admitted failure" and asks to be allowed to "set forth Cassar in modern light.' 1 
In his theory of history the world in 48 B.C. was exactly like the world in 1907 A.D., 
and the comic satire of the play is the utterance of modern thoughts, allusions, and 
slang of our own times by historic personages of this remote age. His middle-aged 
Cesar is master of war but satiated with it. Made pacific by the sight of nations 
drenched in blood, he values clemency above all things. Efficiency and a genius for 
hard work are the qualities by which he has conquered the world. The serpent of 
the Xile is a charming young barbarian, by turns spitfire, petulant, and kittenish. 
Terrified at the approach of the Roman legions and by rumors of the ferocity of 
Cassar, she has fled from the palace, seeking the protection of a baby sphinx in the 
nearby desert. Caesar, alone, musing upon the vanities of life and the littleness of 
man, finds her cuddled up asleep between the paws of the sphinx. She invites the 
"kind old gentleman" to come up and take the other paw, and warns him that 
Cassar will probably eat him. This scene is quoted in the LIBRARY. Caesar insists 
that Cleopatra return to the palace and act the queen without fear, and as the 
Roman soldiers salute her companion, she falls into his arms sobbing with relief. 
Ptolemy, king of Egypt, who disputes his sister's reign, is a boy of ten. Brittanicus, 
Caesar's secretary, the exponent of respectability from the British Isles, is shocked to 
learn that the custom of Egypt makes the brother and sister man and wife. Cleopatra longs for power to cut off her brother's head, and poison her slaves to see them 
wriggle. During the siege by the Egyptians, while Caesar waits for reinforcements, 
Cleopatra is a prisoner in the palace. She passes the Roman guards by rolling herself 
in a rug which she sends to Caesar. Caesar is most noble when he rebukes Cleopatra, 
drunk with her newly-discovered power, for procuring the assassination of an enemy. 
Caesar departs for Rome with the promise that he will send Mark Antony back as a 
present. The curtain falls with the Queen in tears, but expressing the hope, nevertheless, that Caesar will never return.</summary>

A.D. A book of biographies of the Roman emperors from Julius Caesar to Domitian;

much of which may have been fiction. It throws hardly any light on the society of

a sentimental youth, who tells his own story, is the secretary of a Mr. Falkland, a 
gentleman of fortune, cold, proud, and an absolute recluse. Caleb learns that his 
patron had once been a favorite in society; his retiring habits dating from his trial 
some years earlier for the murder of one Tyrrel, a man of bad character, who had 
publicly insulted him. Falkland having been acquitted, two laborers, men of 
excellent reputation, both of whom had reason to hate the knavish Tyrrel, have 
been hanged on circumstantial evidence. Caleb, a sort of religious Paul Pry, is 
convinced that Falkland is the murderer, and taxes him with the crime. Falkland 
confesses it, but threatens Caleb with death should he betray his suspicions. The 
frightened secretary runs away in the night; is seized, and charged with the theft of 
Mr. Falkland's jewels, which are found hidden among his belongings. He escapes 
from jail only to fall among thieves, is re-arrested, and makes a statement to a 
magistrate of Falkland's guilt, a statement which is not believed. The trial comes on; 
Falkland declines to prosecute, and the victim is set at liberty. Falkland, whose 
one idea in life is to keep his name unspotted, then offers to forgive Caleb and assist 
him if he will recant. When he refuses, his enemy has him shadowed, and manages 
tri hound him out of every corner of refuge by branding him as a thief. Caleb, driven 
to hay, makes a formal accusation before the judge of assizes and many witnesses. 
Falkland, in despair, acknowledges his guilt, and shortly after dies, leaving Caleb 
who, most curiously, has passionately lo\ed him all this time the victim of an

Englishwoman named Hermione Lester who marries a man named Maurice Delarey, 
ten years her junior. At the time of her marriage Hermione is thirty-four and while 
having a striking personality is very plain in form and feature. Her husband on 
the contrary is very handsome and has the coloring of the south, which shows his 
Sicilian blood that he has inherited from his grandmother. Hermione has a warm 
friend in Emile Artois, an author and a man of genius, and between them a strong 
platonic friendship has existed for some years. Before her marriage Hermione 
brings about a meeting between the two men and though Artois is impressed with 
Delarey T s beauty and charm of manner he cannot help a feeling of distrust. Hermione and Maurice go to Sicily on their honeymoon as the latter has never been 
there, and Hermione, who loves it, feels sure he will share her enthusiasm. Her 
anticipations are realized as Maurice enters at once into the spirit of the place and is 
actually boyish in his enjoyment of everything. After a couple of months of happiness Hermione is called to the bedside of Artois in Africa, where he is thought to be 
dying. Hermione, however, nurses him back to health and after several weeks of 
convalescence is able to bring him back with her to Sicily. During her absence 
Maurice, who is lonely and somewhat piqued that she should leave him, amuses 
himself with the friendship of a pretty Sicilian girl named Maddelena. The acquaintance which begins innocently ends however in wrong doing, as "the call of

He is overwhelmed with shame at the thought of Hermione's learning of his falseness, 
and upon her return both she and Artois notice the change that has taken place in 
him. Hermione ascribes it to jealousy of Artois, but the latter interprets it differently. Maurice goes to bathe and is murdered by Salvatore, Maddelena's father, 
and his body is found in the water. The truth is known by Artois and a faithful 
servant named Gaspare, but they hide everything from Hermione and she mourns 
truly for her husband whose character remains for her unblemished.</summary>

Newman tells us that this is an attempt to imagine, from a Catholic point of view, 
the feelings and mutual relations of Christians and heathen at the period described. 
The first few chapters were written in 1848, the rest not until 1855. The events here  
related occur in Proconsular Africa; giving opportunity for description of the luxurious mode of life, the customs and ceremonies, then and there prevailing. Agellius, 
a Christian, loves Callista, a beautiful Greek girl, who sings like a Muse, dances like 
a Grace, and recites like Minerva, besides being a rare sculptor. Jucundus, uncle to 
Agellius, hopes she may lead him from Christianity; but she wishes to learn more 
concerning that faith. Agellius, falling ill, is nursed by Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, 
who is in hiding. A plague of locusts comes. Frenzied by their devastations and 
the consequent famine, the mob rises against the Christians. Agellius is summoned 
to his uncle for safety. Callista, going to his hut to warn him, meets Cyprian, who 
gives her the Gospel of St. Luke. While they discourse, the mob approaches and 
they are captured. Cyprian and Agellius, however, are helped to escape. Callista 
studies St. Luke and embraces Christianity. She refuses to abjure her religion, is 
put to death by torture, is canonized, and still works miracles. Her body is rescued 
by Agellius and given Christian burial. Her death proves the resurrection of the 
church at Sicca where she died: the heathen said that her history affected them 
with constraining force. Agellius becomes a bishop, and is likewise martyred and

younger, was published in 1848, the celebrated play founded upon it appearing in 
1852 at the Vaudeville Theatre in Paris. The popularity of both the novel and the 
play is owing, perhaps, to the fact that the incidents of the story admit of many 
interpretations of the character of the heroine. Like other women of her class, she 
is linked to, is indeed a representative of, the most inexplicable yet most powerful 
force in human nature. Camille is the portrait of a woman who actually lived in 
Paris. Dumas had seen her, and relates a love story of which she was the central 
figure. Like Aspasia, she has a strange immortality. Each reader of the book, 
like each spectator of the play, gains an impression of Camille that is largely subjective. 
The elusiveness of the personality, the young ardor that forced Dumas to tell the

  <summary author="Shaw, Bernard (1856-1950)" title="Candida" print_title="Candida">CANDIDA, by Bernard Shaw (1897). Candida, the heroine of this successful comedy, 
is the engaging wife of a clergyman who is fond of preaching in the pulpit and out of it. 
When Eugene Marchbanks, a youthful poet, tells him he is in love with Candida, the 
Rev. James Morell first laughs with condescending superiority but is finally goaded 
into dropping his rhetoric to shake Eugene. Though Eugene screams with fright, 
he has the courage of his ideas and succeeds in terrifying the clergyman out of his 
complacent attitude of model husband. The Rev. James, however, is a likeable, 
sincere person, not simply the "moralist and windbag " Eugene calls him. Eugene is 
an extraordinary character, reminiscent of Shelley, with the range of vision of a seer, 
beyond the comprehension of the conventional preacher. He is too sensitive for the 
everyday world, in which the clergyman deals out spiritual gruel, suitable for "cheap 
earthenware souls, " and his domestic wife soils her beautiful hands to fill the lamps 
and slice the onions for supper. The two men agree that Candida shall choose 
between them. This scene of the "choice" is quoted in the LIBRARY. Candida 
calmly asks for bids since she is up at auction. Her husband offers her his strength, 
and Eugene, his weakness. She says she will choose the weaker of the two, and to his 
surprise it is her husband who holds her because of his need and dependence on her 
loving care. One of the most audacious speeches in the play is Candida 's reply to 
her husband, when he tells her he relies on her goodness and purity. She says, "I 
would give them both to Eugene as willingly as I would give my shawl to a beggar 
dying of cold, if there were nothing else to restrain me. Put your trust in my love 
for you, James, for if that went I should care very little for your sermons mere 
phrases that you cheat yourself and others with every day." Candida's frankness 
wounds her big boy of a husband at first, but her love convinces his pride. Eugene 
rejects this idea of love, and departs cured of his infatuation. </summary>
  <summary author="Voltaire (1694-1778)" title="Candide" print_title="Candide">CANDIDE, ou, L'OPTIMISME, a satirical novel by Voltaire, was published 
anonymously in 1759, with the fictitious statement appended that it had been translated from the German by "M. le Docteur Ralph." Voltaire's aim was to ridicule 
the facile optimism so current in the eighteenth century, particularly as expressed in 
Pope's "Whatever is is right," and the dictum of Leibnitz that "All is for the best in 
this, the best of all possible worlds." The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 and the sufferings caused by the Seven Years' War had done something to shake this creed. Voltaire determined to complete the overthrow by a burlesque narrative in which 
optimism should be reduced to absurdity. The hero, Candide, is the illegitimate 
scion of a noble German family. He is brought up at the Castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh, where he learns from the philosopher, Pangloss, that every effect has a 
cause, that every cause has a sufficient reason, and that all is for the best in this, the 
best of all possible worlds. Caught by the baron in making love to his daughter, 
Cunegonde, Candide is kicked out of the castle, forced into military service, beaten 
for desertion, forced into a great battle, and made a witness of the atrocities committed in neighboring villages. Escaping from the army he falls in with a humane 
Anabaptist, Jacques, and later with Pangloss who tells him that the baron's castle 
has been destroyed by the soldiers and Cune*gonde outraged and killed. Pangloss, 
who is suffering from the most abhorred of maladies, is cured by the kindly Jacques, 
and the three set out on a business voyage to Lisbon. They are shipwrecked in a 
dreadful tempest and the Anabaptist is drowned. Candide and Pangloss on arrival 
find the city destroyed by the famous earthquake of 1755 and thirty thousand people 
killed. Pangloss, attempting to console the survivors by his usual formula, is arrested 
for heresy and is hanged by the Inquisition, while Candide is flogged. He is, however, 
rescued by Cune"gonde, who had not been killed but had been sold to a Portuguese 
Jew, who with the Grand Inquisitor, kept her as mistress. Candide manages to kill 
both these personages, and he and his lady love make their escape to Cadiz, where 
Candide obtains a captain's commission in an expedition against the Jesuit rebellion 
in Paraguay. During the journey an old attendant of Cunegonde, who has made her 
escape with them, relates her adventures, which are much more distressing than those 
of the young people. On arrival at Buenos Ayres Cunegonde is seized by the governor and Candide is forced to fly to the rebels by the advent of Spanish officials who 
are pursuing the'murderer of the Inquisitor. Among the rebels he finds the brother 
of Cunegonde, a priest and military commandant, who at first welcomes him, but 
whose insults when he hears of Candide's aspirations to the hand of his sister lead 
to a fight in which Candide severely wounds him. Accompanied by a half-breed 
servant, Cacambo, Candide traverses the forests of South America, visits the country 
of El Dorado, where the people are virtuous, brings away great treasures, despatches 
his servant to win back Cunegonde from Buenos Ayres, and sails for Venice, with a 
pessimistic philosopher, Martin, who believes the world ruled by evil. They visit 
France, where they meet with frivolity and dishonesty, touch the English coast, 
where they witness the execution of Admiral Byng "pour encourager les autres, " and 
sojourn in Venice, where they make the acquaintance of the cultured and fastidious 
Pococurante, a nobleman who is weary of all the pleasures that the world can give. 
At length Candide gets word from Cacambo that Cunegonde is a slave in Constantinople. Cacambo had faithfully ransomed her and started for Venice, but they 
had been seized by a pirate and sold as slaves in Turkey. Candide, Cacambo, and 
Martin immediately go to Constantinople. On a galley they find two slaves who 
turn out to be Cunegonde 's brother and Pangloss. Their lives have been miraculously saved, and by a series of adventures they have come to be rowers in the same 
galley. Candide now finds and ransoms Cunegonde, who has unfortunately become 
very ugly; but regard for his promise and anger at her brother, who still refuses his 
consent and is finally sent back to the galley, confirms Candide in his purpose of 
marrying her. The whole group now settles on a little farm beside the Bosphorus, 
where, on the advice of an old peasant, they find a measure of content in hard work. 
Pangloss is still an optimist; Martin says that work without thought is the only 
means of rendering life supportable; and Candida's unfailing motto is "il faut cultiver 
notrc jardin. " Voltaire never wrote a more brilliant polemic than this, and in spite 
of its cynicism the book has a core of sound sense, vehement hatred of oppression, 
and wise practical philosophy.</summary>
  <summary author="Thoreau, Henry David (1817-1862)" title="Cape Cod" print_title="Cape Cod">CAPE COD, by Henry D. Thoreau (1865). Until Thoreau arrived to make acquaintance with its hard yet fascinating personality, Cape Cod remained unknown 
and almost unseen, though often visited and written about by tourists and students 
of nature. Something in the asceticism, or the directness, or the amazing keenness, of 
Thoreau's mind brought him into sympathetic understanding of the thing he saw, 
and he interpreted the level stretches of shore with absolute fidelity. In these pages 
the melancholy land looks as "long, lank, and brown" as it looks lying under the 
gray autumn sky. Nor does he spare any prosaic detail. The salt wholesomeness 
of his sea breeze does not wholly overcome the offensive flotsam and jetsam drifted 
up on the sand; but on the other hand, with the simplest means, he communicates 
what he feels so fully, the savage grandeur of the sea, and its evanescent and ever-changing loveliness. In this, as in all his other books, Thoreau rises from the observation of the most familiar and commonplace facts, the comparison of the driest bones 
of observed data, to the loftiest spiritual speculation, the most poetic interpretation 
of nature. His accuracy almost convinces the reader that his true field was history 
or science, until some aerial flight of his fancy seems to show him as a poet lost to the 
Muse. But whatever his gifts, he was above all, as he shows himself in "Cape Cod," 
Nature's dearest observer, to whom she had given the microscopic eye, the weighing 
mind, and the interpretative voice.</summary>

evolution of character. The hero is an American boy, Harvey Cheyne, the son 
of a millionaire, a spoiled little puppy, but with latent possibilities of manliness 
smothered by his pampered life. A happy accident to the boy opens the way for the 
development of his better nature. In a fit of seasickness he falls from the deck of a 
big Atlantic liner, and is picked up by a dory from the Gloucester fishing schooner 
We're Here, commanded by Disko Troop, a man of strong moral character and 
purpose. This skipper is unmoved by Harvey's tales of his father's wealth and 
importance, nor will he consent to take him back to New York until the fishing 
season is over; but proposes instead to put the boy to work on the schooner at ten 
dollars a month. This enforced captivity is Harvey's regeneration. He learns to 
know the value of work, or obedience, of good-will. He is sent back to his father as a 
boy really worth the expense of bringing up. Mr. Cheyne returns good office with 
good office by securing Troop's son, Dan, a chance to rise as a seaman. 

The simple story is told with a directness and clarity characteristic of Kipling, 
who appears so little in the pages of the book that they might be leaves from life 
itself. The strength and charm of the story lies in its rare detachment from the 
shackles of the author's personality, and in its intrinsic morality.</summary>

James Parton. This elaborate work, first published in 1877, is full of information 
to the student of caricature, giving over 300 illustrations of the progress of the art 
from its origin to modern times. Beginning with the caricature of India, Egypt, 
Greece, and Rome, as preserved in ceramics, frescoes, mosaics, and other mural 
decoration, Mr. Parton points out that the caricature of the Middle Ages is chiefly 
to be found in the grotesque ornamentations of Gothic architecture; in the ornamentation of castles, the gargoyles and other decorative exterior stonework of cathedrals, 
and the wonderful wood-carvings of choir and stalls. Since that time, printing has 
preserved for us abundant examples. The great mass of pictorial caricature is 
political; the earliest prints satirizing the Reformation, then the issues of the English
Revolution, the French Revolution, our own Civil War, the policies and blunders of 
the Second Empire, and many other lesser causes and questions. Social caricature is 
represented by its great apostle, Hogarth, and by Gillray, Cruikshank, and many 
lesser men in France, Spain, and Italy, England and America; and in all times and all 
countries, women and matrimony, dress and servants, chiefly occupy the artist's pencil. When this volume was published, the delightful Du Maurier had not reached a 
prominent place on Punch, and the American comic papers, Life, Puck, and the rest, 
were not born; but English caricature of the past century is treated at great length. 
The book opens with a picture of two 'Pigmy Pugilists ' from a wall in Pompeii, and 
closes with a sentimental street Arab of Woolf exactly like those which for twenty 
years after he continued to draw. The volume is not only amusing, but most 
instructive as a compendium of social history. </summary>

Its seventeen essays present a vivid picture of the life of Spain. Joining a graceful and 
brilliant style with the happiest perception of the significance of things seen, the 
author finds a subject worthy of his interpretation in that mediaeval civilization of 
the Iberian peninsula which has lasted over into the nineteenth century a civilization where the Church holds sway as it did in the Middle Ages: where the upper 
classes believe in devils, and the peasants dare not yawn without crossing themselves, 
lest an imp find lodgment within them; where duels are fought in all deadliness 
whenever a caballero's delicate honor is offended; where alone the Carnival survives 
as an unforced, naive, popular fe"te; where rich and poor play together, and enjoy 
themselves like children. Madrid, Segovia, Toledo, Alcala", Seville, are so described 
that we see the people abroad, at home, at church, at the bull-fights, at the miracle-play, in the brilliant light of their sub-tropical skies. The whole history of Spain

by Frank R. Stockton. This chronicle sets forth the curious experiences of Mrs. 
Leeks and Mrs. Aleshine; two middle-aged widows, from a little New England 
village, who, having "means," decide to see the world and pay a visit to the son of 
one of them, who has gone into business in Japan. On the steamer crossing the 
Pacific they meet a young Mr. Craig, who tells the story. The two ladies and Mr. 
Craig are cast away in most preposterous circumstances, on a lonely isle in mid-ocean. Many of the scenes, like the escape from drowning of the two widows, 
are of the very essence of true humor, of a grotesque form; and the story-teller's 
invention and humor never once flag. It is a good example of Stockton's unique 
method of story-telling the matter extremely absurd and the manner extremely 
grave, the narrative becoming more and more matter-of-fact and minutely realistic, 
as the events themselves grow more and more incredible. </summary>
  <summary author="Walpole, Horace (1717-1797)" title="The Castle of Otranto" print_title="The Castle of Otranto">CASTLE OF OTRANTO, THE, by Horace Walpole. It is curious that a man 
with no purpose in life beyond drinking tea with Lady Suffolk, or filling quarto 
note-books with court gossip, should produce an epoch-making book; for the 
'Castle of Otranto,' with its natural personages actuated by supernatural 
agencies, is the prototype of that extraordinary series of romantic fictions 
which began with Anne RadclifFe, and was superseded only by the Waverley 
novels. 

The reader's interest is aroused with the first page of the romance, and never 
flags. Conrad, son of Manfred, Prince of Otranto, about to marry Isabella, daughter 
of the Marquis of Vicenza, is found in the castle court, dashed to pieces under an 
enormous helmet. Now deprived of an heir, Manfred declares to Isabella his intention of marrying her himself; when, to his horror, his grandfather's portrait 
descends from the wall, and signs to Manfred to follow him. Isabella meanwhile, 
by the assistance of a peasant, Theodore, escapes to Friar Jerome. For this intervention, Manfred, now returned from his tete-a-tete with his grandfather's phantom, leads the youth into the court to be executed, when he is found to be Jerome's 
son, and is spared. At this moment a herald appears demanding of Manfred, 
in the name of Prince Frederick, his daughter Isabella and the resignation of the 
principality of Otranto usurped from Frederick; who follows the proclamation, 
is admitted co the castle and informed of Manfred's desire to marry Isabella, when 
word comes that she has escaped from Jerome's protection. A series of ludicrous 
portents hastens the denouement: drops of blood flow from the nose of the statue 
of Alphonso, the prince from whose heirs the dukedom has been wrested; unrelated 
arms and legs appear in various parts of the castle; and finally, in the midst of the 
rocking of earth, and the rattling of "more than mortal armor," the walls of the 
castle are thrown down, the inmates having presumably escaped. From the ruins 
the statue of Alphonso, raised to gigantic proportions, cries, "Behold in Theodore 
the true heir of Alphonso." Isabella, having been rescued at the critical moment, 
is of course married to Theodore. 

This wildly romantic tale, published in 1764, was enthusiastically received by 
the public; who, as Sir Leslie Stephen so well says, "rejoiced to be reminded that 
men once lived in castles, believed in the Devil, and did not take snuff or wear 
powdered wigs." </summary>
  <summary author="Edgeworth, Maria (1767-1849)" title="Castle Rackrent" print_title="Castle Rackrent">CASTLE RACKRENT, by Maria Edgeworth. This, as the author announces, is 
"an Hibernian tale taken from facts and from the manners of the Irish squire before 
the year 1782." The memoirs of the Rackrent family are recounted by Thady 
Quirk, an old steward, who has been from childhood devotedly attached to the house 
of Rackrenfc. The old retainer* s descriptions of the several masters under whom he 
has served, vividly portray various types of the "fine old Irish gentleman"; foremost among them all being Sir Patrick Rackrent, "who lived and died a monument of old Irish hospitality," and whose "funeral was such a one as was never 
known before or since in the county." Then comes Sir Murtagh Rackrent, whose 
famous legal knowledge brought the poor tenants little consolation; and his wife, 
of the Skinflint family, who "had a charity school for poor children, where they were 
taught to read and write gratis, and where they were kept spinning gratis for my 
lady in return." Next follows Sir Kit, "God bless him! He valued a guinea as 
little as any man, money was no more to him than dirt, and his gentleman and groom 
and all belonging to him the same." Also his Jewish wife, whom he imprisons in 
her room for seven years because she refuses to give up her diamonds. In the 
words of Thady, "it was a shame for her not to have shown more duty, when he 
condescended to ask so often for such a bit of a trifle in his distresses, especially 
when he all along made it no secret that he married her for money." The memoirs 
close with the history of Sir Condy Rackrent, who dies from quaffing on a wager 
a great horn of punch, after having squandered the remainder of the family fortune. 
'Castle Rackrent' was issued in 1801, and was the first of a series of successful novels 
produced by the author, whose descriptions of Irish character, whether grave or 
gay, are unsurpassed. Sir Walter Scott has acknowledged that his original idea, 
when he began his career as a novelist, was to be to Scotland what Miss Edgeworth 
was to Ireland.</summary>
  <summary author="White, William Hale (1831-1913)" title="Catharine Furze" print_title="Catharine Furze">CATHARINE FURZE, "by Mark Rutherford; edited by his friend Reuben Shapcott." Published in 1893, this book opens with a description of Easthorpe, the 
market town of the English Eastern Midlands, in 1840. The two inns are patronized by landlords, farmers, tenants, and commercial travelers; especially on election 
days. The story centres about the life of Mr. and Mrs. Furze, and their daughter 
Catharine, aged about nineteen. Mike Catchpole, by an accident in the factory 
of Mr. Furze, loses his eyesight. Catharine, with a sense of justice, insists that 
he shall be made an apprentice in the business. The girl is sent to school to the 
Misses Ponsonby, who are very strict in their religious habits and manner of instruction, and whose pupils are questioned upon the weekly sermon by the preacher, 
Mr. Cardew. He has not learned the art of being happy with his wife; and when 
he meets Catharine they discuss Milton, Satan, and the divine eternal plan. Cardew's presence is inspiriting to her. Tom Catchpole, a clerk in her father's store, 
worships Catharine from afar. At last he confesses his love and she refuses him. 
After her return from school she finds life utterly uninteresting, having no scope 
for her powers. When she falls ill and fades away, Cardew is sent for: she tells 
him that he has saved her. "By 'their love for each other they were both saved." 
She takes up her life once more, and the book ends without a climax almost 
without incident. Written with an almost heartless impersonality, it is a striking portraiture of that English lower middle-class life which Matthew Arnold 
pronounced so deadly for mind and soul. It might be called a tragedy of the 
unfulfilled. </summary>
  <summary author="Cable, George Washington (1844-1925)" title="The Cavalier" print_title="The Cavalier">CAVALIER, THE, by George W. Cable (1901). This is a lively story of love and 
adventure in the days of the Civil War, and details the experiences of Richard 
Thorndyke Smith, a young soldier in the Southern army, who gives the reader 
his personal reminiscences. At the age of nineteen he becomes a scout under 
Lieutenant Ferry; figures in many thrilling adventures and performs many valorous 
deeds. Ferry, whose rightful name is Edgard Ferry Durand, is a brilliant and 
fascinating character whose noble and fearless nature makes him loved by men and 
women alike. He has fallen victim to the charms of Charlotte Oliver, a beautiful 
and daring Confederate spy, but, owing to the fact that she is already married, he 
feels the hopelessness of his love. Charlotte, who also goes by the name of Coralie 
Rothvelt, is wife in name only of a miserable rascal who deceived her into marrying 
him, but whose real character she discovered immediately after the ceremony, and 
who has done everything he could to make her life wretched. Charlotte is devoted 
to the Confederate cause and undertakes perilous risks without thought of danger, 
and is at the front in time of battle, caring for the wounded and dying. Although 
she reciprocates Ferry's affection, she will not encourage him until she is absolutely 
convinced of the death of her husband, who finally dies as a traitor, after having 
attempted her life and seriously wounded her. At last, her courage and fidelity 
are rewarded and she becomes the wife of the man she loves. Smith, who has been 
the faithful ally of both Charlotte and Ferry, wins the love of Camille Harper, the 
Major's daughter, and the curtain falls on the closing of the war, with strife and 
discord at an end. This story exhibits the author's simple and unaffected manner 
of writing, and the plot runs with unusual swiftness and ease. </summary>
  <summary author="Martinengo-Cesaresco, Evelyn Lilian Hazeldine Carrington, contessa (1852-1931)" title="Cavour" print_title="Cavour">CAVOUR, a short biography, by the Countess Evelyn Martinengo-Cesaresco, 
was published in 1904, as one of the 'Foreign Statesmen Series, ' edited by Professor 
Bury. In a succinct yet clear and complete manner the writer tells the remarkable 
story of Cavour's achievement of the unification of Italy. Born in 1810, the younger 
son of a noble Piedmontese house, Camillo Benso, Count 'Cavour, early manifested 
tendencies strangely out of harmony with his rank and surroundings in a petty 
Italian principality. He was supremely interested in scientific farming and in 
political life, a pronounced Liberal, and an opponent of clerical influence in secular 
government. Travel in France and Italy strengthened these views. Just prior 
to the Revolutionary year of 1848, he started at Turin a newspaper entitled 'II 
Riaorgimento, ' a name which has since been applied to the movement which it 
inaugurated for the unification of Italy. Through this paper he was able to influence 
the King of Piedmont, Charles Albert, to declare war on Austria, in order to drive 
her out of Italy. After the failure of the Piedmontese at Novara and the abdication 
of the king, Cavour, now called to the government, induced the new King, Victor 
Emmanuel, to join England and France in the Crimean war, hoping thus to gain 
the support of these powers for a renewed attempt to liberate Italy from Austria. 
As a consequence, Cavour, representing Piedmont, was given a place at the peace 
conference in 1856. Finally in 1859 he succeeded in committing Napoleon III. 
to an alliance, and with his aid, drove Austria from Lombardy. Insurrections then 
broke out in the other Italian states, particularly in the kingdom of Naples, which 
was conquered by Garibaldi and his thousand volunteers (1860). By the close of 
the year Austria had agreed to make peace and the whole of Italy except Rome was 
declared an independent kingdom in February, 1861. In the same year Cavour died 
of fatigue brought on by overwork (June 6, 1861). His career, dominated as it 
was by the determination to set Italy free, is an inspiring one and the writer has 
risen to the height of her subject the unification of Italy. She tells how he 
gradually prepared the way for war against Austria, by strengthening the army, by 
diplomacy, and by co-operating with Garibaldi up to a certain point. "Possibly," 
she says, "he was the only continental statesman who ever saw liberty in an Anglo-Saxon light." At first he had to work against distrust, but his extraordinary powers 
as a diplomatist enabled him to succeed where Mazzini and Garibaldi would have 
failed. None will question his unwavering devotion to the cause of the emancipation 
of Italy. His extraordinary political acumen may be seen in his anticipation of 
the advance of Prussia. "In 1848," says the Countess Cesaresco, "he prophesied 
that Germanism would disturb the European equilibrium, and that the future German Empire would aim at becoming a naval power in order to combat and rival 
England on the seas. But he saw that the rise of Prussia meant the decline of 
Austria, and this was all that, as an Italian statesman, with Venetia still in chains, 
he was bound to consider."</summary>
  <summary author="Cellini, Benvenuto (1500-1571)" title="The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini" print_title="The Autobiography\nof\nBenvenuto Cellini">CELLINI, BENVENUTO, THE LIFE OF, one of the few world-famous autobiographies, and itself the Italian Renaissance as expressed in personality, was 
written between the years 1558 and 1562. It circulated in MS. and was copied frequently, until its publication in 1730. The original and authoritative MS. belongs 
to the Laurentian Collection in Florence. It was written "for the most part by 
Michele di Goro Yestri, the youth whom Cellini employed as his amanuensis. Perhaps we owe its abrupt and infelicitous conclusion to the fact that Benvenuto disliked the trouble of writing with his own hand. From notes upon the codex it 
appears that this was the MS. submitted to Benedetto Varchi in 1559. It once 
belonged to Andrea, the son of Lorenzo Cavalcanti. His son, Lorenzo Cavalcanti 
gave it to the poet Redi, who used it as a testo di lingua for the Delia Cruscan vocabulary. Subsequently it passed into the hands of the booksellers, and was bought 
by L. Poirot, who bequeathed it, on his death in 1825, to the Laurentian Library.
Cellini's autobiography has been translated into German by Goethe, into Enlish by Nugent, Roscoe, and Symonds, and into French by Leopold Leclauche. 
Symonds's translation is pre-eminent for its truthfulness and sympathy. It is 
fitting that Cellini's record of himself should be translated into the foremost modern 
tongues, since he stood for a civilization unapproached in cosmopolitan character 
since the age of Sophocles. Judged by his own presentment, he was an epitome 
of that world which sprang from the marriage of Faust with Helen. He, like his 
contemporaries, was a "natural" son of Greece; witnessing to his wayward birth 
in his adoration of beauty, in his violent passions, in his magnificent bombast, in 
his turbulent, highly colored life, in his absence of spirituality, in his close clinging 
to the sure earth. He was most mediaeval in that whatever feeling he had, of joy 
in the tangible or fear of the intangible, was intensely alive. "This is no book: 
who touches this touches a man." </summary>

This novel pictures in a striking and accurate manner the bourgeois life of Paris at 
the time of the Restoration. Ce*sar Birotteau, a native of the provinces, comes to 
the city in his youth, works his way up until he becomes the proprietor of a perfumery 
establishment, and amasses a considerable fortune. He is decorated with the Cross 
of the Legion of Honor, in consequence of having been an ardent Loyalist; and this 
mark of distinction, coupled with his financial success, causes him to become more 
and more ambitious. He grows extravagant, indulges in speculation, and loses 
everything. This stroke of misfortune brings out the strength of character which, 
during his prosperity, had remained concealed beneath many petty foibles. In this 
story the life of the French shopkeeper who values his credit as his dearest possession, 
and his failure as practically death, is faithfully portrayed. The other characters 
in the book are lifelike portraits. Constance, the faithful and sensible wife of Birotteau, and his gentle daughter Ce*sarine, are in pleasing contrast to many of the women 
Balzac has painted. Du Tillet, the unscrupulous clerk, who repays his master's 
kindness by hatred and dishonesty; Roquin the notary; Vauquelin the great chemist; 
and Pillerault, uncle of Constance, are all striking individualities. The book is 
free from any objectionable atmosphere, and is exceedingly realistic as to manners 
and customs. It has been admirably translated into English by Katharine Prescott 
Wonneley.</summary>

the experience of a pretty Western girl, Kitty Ellison, who, while traveling on the 
St. Lawrence with her cousins Colonel and Mrs. Ellison, has an "affaire du cceur" 
with Mr. Miles Arbuton, of Boston. The latter, an aristocrat of the most conventional type, is thrown much with Kitty on the steamer, and finally falls in love with 
her. Mrs. Ellison, a rather commonplace but kind-hearted woman, sprains her 
ankle, and this misfortune delays their party in Quebec. During this interval Mr. 
Arbuton and Kitty explore the city, an occupation affording ample time for 'he 
maturing of their friendship. Arbuton at length declares himself, and Kitty asks 
for time to consider his proposal. She feels the unsuitability of the match; he 
being of distinguished family, rich and cultivated, while she is a poor girl, with little 
to boast of but her own natural charms. She finally accepts him, however, when 
some of his aristocratic friends appear on the scene. He ignores Kitty for the time 
being and leaves her by herself, while he does the honors for the newcomers. She 
realizes that he is ashamed of her, and decides to give him up. On his return she 
tells him of her decision, and resists his entreaties to overlook his conduct. The 
story ends with the departure of the Ellisons from Quebec, and the reader is left 
in ignorance of the fate of Mr. Miles Arbuton. The book contains many charming 
descriptions of the picturesque scenery and places about Quebec, and the story is 
told with delightful airiness and charm.</summary>
  <summary author="Anonymous" title="La Chanson de Roland" print_title="La Chanson de Roland">CHANSON DE ROLAND. This is the culmination of a cycle of 'Chansons de 
Geste' or Songs of Valor, celebrating the heroic achievements of Charlemagne, and 
inspired especially by the joy and pride of the triumph of Christian arms over the 
Mohammedan invasion, which, through the gate opened by the Moors of Spain, 
threatened to subdue all Europe. The Song of Roland or of Roncesvalles celebrates 
the valor of Roland, a Count Paladin of Charlemagne, who, on the retreat of the 
King from an expedition against the Moors in Spain, is cut oft with the rear-guard 
of the army in the pass of Roncevaux; and, fatally wounded in the last desperate 
struggle, crawls away to die beneath the shelter of a rock, against which he strikes 
in vain his sword Durandal, in the effort to break it so that it may not fall into the 
hands of his enemy: 

    "Be no man your master who shall know the fear of man: 
    Long were you in the hands of a captain 
    Whose like shall not be seen in Prance set free!" 

The French text of the 'Chanson' was first published in Paris by M. Francisque 
Michel in 1837, and afterward in many editions. The original form of the lines 
above quoted is as follows: 

    "Ne vos ait hume ki pur altre feietl 
    Mult bon vassal vos ad lung tens tenue: 
    Jamais n'ert tel in France la solue." 

Around this incident have grown a multitude of heroic and romantic tales which 
have taken form in all the mediaeval literature of Europe; but especially in Italy, 
where however the hero appears with little more than the name to identify him, 
in the 'Orlando Furioso' of Arios+o, and the 'Orlando Innamorato' of Boiardo. 
Tyrwhitt, in his edition of Chaucer, was the first to call the attention of English 
readers to the ' Chanson '; but English tradition has it that the song was sung by 
the Norman Taillef er just before the battle of Hastings. The best and oldest French 
MS., called the "Digby," is preserved in the Bodleian library at Oxford. The 
French poem contains 6,000 lines. A Fragment of 1,049 lines, translated in Middle 
English from what is known as the Lansdowne MS., is published by the Early 
English Text Society.</summary>
  <summary author="Rostand, Edmond (1868-1918)" title="Chantecler: Play in Four Acts" print_title="Chantecler:\nPlay in Four Acts">CHANTECLER, by Edmond Rostand (1910). The scene of this romantic French 
drama is a farmyard, the hero, a cock, and the dramatis personse, hens, guinea hens, 
ducks, turkeys, a blackbird, a dog, and a cat. Chantecler believes that his cock-a-doodle-doo each morning brings the day, that the sun rises at his call. He confides 
this secret of his song to a lovely hen-pheasant who has flown into the barnyard to 
escape a hunting dog. She falls in love with the splendid self-assertion of the Gallic 
cock. His enemies the owls, who hate the day, and the cat, conspire against the 
cock. At the guinea hen's five o'clock tea he is driven to fight and is nearly killed 
by a gamecock, armed with a steel spur. The fickle crowd of hens applaud the 
gamecock until a hawk appears and Chantecler asserts his real supremacy. He 
leaves them and goes to the forest with the pheasant. She is jealous of the Dawn, 
wishing to rule alone in his heart. One morning she covers his eyes with her wings, 
and he discovers that the ungrateful Dawn has come without his helj>. Disillusioned, 
he suffers, but regains his faith in himself and leayes her to return to the barnyard, 
to cheer his fellows with his call to the sun. 

    " For in gray mornings when poor beasts awake. 
    Not daring to believe that night is done, 
    My ringing clarion will replace the sun." 

The pheasant sees the hunter and fearing for Chantecler, flies up, forgetting the snare 
of the net, in which she is caught. The symbolism of the play is obvious. The 
chattering hens, the turkey, a solemn pretentious philosopher, the tuft-hunting 
guinea hen and her troupe of celebrities, the blackbird, cynical and modern, are a 
delightful satire on human society. Chantecler's hymn to the sun is quoted in the 
LIBRARY. </summary>

This story opens on the last day of the year 1750, and gives a detailed account of 
the famous Liberties or Rules of the old Fleet prison in London, and of the Fleet 
marriages. These "Rules'* were houses in certain streets near the Fleet Market, 
where prisoners for debt were allowed to live, outside the prison, on payment of 
fees. Among these prisoners were clergymen, who performed clandestine marriages. A regular trade sprang up, touters were employed to bring clients, and every 
species of enormity was practiced. Gregory Shovel was one of these clergy, and so 
plumed himself on his success in this iniquitous traffic that he took the name of 
"Chaplain of the Fleet," which gives the book its title, the whole plot turning 
upon one of these Fleet marriages. This novel is considered one of the best of those 
written under the firm-name of Besant and Rice. </summary>
  <summary author="Rowson, Susanna Haswell (1762-1824)" title="Charlotte Temple" print_title="Charlotte Temple">CHARLOTTE TEMPLE, by Susanna Haswell Rowson. This 'Tale of Truth' 
was written about 1790. It was, if not the first, one of the first works of fiction 
mtten in America; 25,000 copies were sold within a few years; and it has been 
epublished again and again. It was written by an Englishwoman who came to 
imerica with her husband, the leader of the band attached to a British regiment, 
he was for some years favorably known as an actress, and then opened a boarding school which for twenty-five years ranked first among such institutions in New 
England. Her other writings were numerous, but were soon forgotten, while 'Charlotte Temple' still sells. It is a true story, the heroine's real name being Stanley. 
She was granddaughter to the Earl of Derby; and her betrayer, Col. John Montressor of the English army, was a relative of Mrs. Rowson herself. Charlotte's grave 
in Trinity Churchyard, New York, but a few feet away from Broadway, is marked 
by a stone sunk in the grass. Mrs. Dall, in her 'Romance of the Association,' tells 
us that Charlotte's daughter was adopted by a rich man, and in after years met 
the son of her true father, Montressor, or Montrevale as the book has it. They 
fell in love, and the young man showed his dying father a miniature of his sweetheart's mother (the wretched Charlotte), to whom she bore a striking likeness, and 
thus the truth was made known. The story in brief is this: Charlotte Temple, 
a girl of fifteen elopes from school with Montrevale, an army officer; they come to 
America, where he deserts her and marries an heiress. She gives birth to a daughter 
and dies of want. The style and language are strangely old-fashioned, hysterics 
and fainting fits occur on every page; yet a romantic interest will always attach to it. </summary>
  <summary author="Swinburne, Algernon Charles (1837-1909)" title="Chastelard, a Tragedy" print_title="Chastelard,\na Tragedy">CHASTELARD, by Algernon Charles Swinburne (1869). The scene of this tragedy 
is laid at Holyrood Castle, during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots. Mary Beaton, 
one of the "four Maries," promises Chastelard to arrange a meeting between him 
and the Queen. When he comes to the audience-room, however, he finds only 
Mary Beaton herself, who, in shame, confesses her love for him. While he is assuring her of his pardon, they are discovered by the other Maries. The Queen, angry 
at what she has heard, tries to make Chastelard confess his desertion of her; and 
declares her intention of marrying Darnley. Chastelard, by the agency of Alary 
Beaton, gains access to the Queen's chamber, discloses himself when she is alone, 
and after having convinced her of his love for her, submits to the guards, who take 
him to prison. Mary, fickle and heartless, in her desire to avoid both the shame of 
letting him live and the shame of putting her lover to death, tries to shift the responsibility to Murray, signs his death-warrant, and orders a reprieve, in quick succession. Then, going in person to the prison, she asks Chastelard to return the reprieve. 
He has already destroyed it; and after one short, happy hour with her, he goes 
bravely to his death. From an upper window in the palace, Mary Beaton watches 
the execution and curses the Queen just as Mary enters with Bothwell. 

In 'Chastelard' Swinburne has portrayed a fickle, heartless, vain, and beautiful queen; and in the few touches given to a character of secondary importance, 
has delicately and distinctly drawn Mary Beaton. The male characters are less 
sympathetic. 

The tragedy is conspicuously one to be read, not acted. It is too long, too much 
lacking in action, and of too sustained an intensity for the stage. The style is 
essentially lyric, full of exquisite lines and phrases; and as a whole, the play presents 
an intense passion in a form of adequate beauty. It contains a number of charming 
French songs, and is dedicated to Victor Hugo. It was published in 1869.</summary>
  <summary author="Morrison, Arthur (1863-1945)" title="A Child of the Jago" print_title="A Child of the Jago">CHILD OF THE JAGO, A, by Arthur Morrison (1896), is a sadly realistic 
sketch of life among the slums of London. The Jago is a name given to certain 
streets in the neighborhood of Shoreditch, East City. The author knows the 
district from residence there, while he was in the employment of a humanitarian society. The "child" is Dicky Perott, whose father, Josh Perott, is a thief, 
bruiser, and murderer, who ends on the gallows. The lad is bred to vice as the 
sparks fly upward, and what few feeble efforts he makes towards a better life are 
nipped in the bud. Yet he has his own queer, warped code of ethics; and when he 
is stricken down by a knife in a street row, dies with a lie on his lips to shield the 
culprit. Dicky feels that on the whole, death is an easy way out of a sorry tangle. 
The Jago scenes are given with photographic distinctness, the dialect is caught, 
the life both external and internal sordid, brutal, incredibly vicious, yet relieved 
with gleams and hints of higher things is depicted with truth and sympathy. 
The study of Father Sturt, the self -sacrificing clergyman is a very suggestive setting-forth of the difficulty of helping these demoralized human beings. The story is one 
of great power, very sombre and painful, but valuable as a statement of the real 
conditions among the lowest class of London poor.</summary>
  <summary author="Zangwill, Israel (1864-1926)" title="Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People" print_title="Children of the Ghetto:\nA Study\nof\na Peculiar People">CHILDREN OF THE GHETTO, by I. ZangwilL This book was published in 1892, 
and is, as the author says, "intended as a study, through typical figures, of a race 
whose persistence is the most remarkable fact in the history of the world." It is 
divided into two parts, the first of which gives the title to the whole, and describes 
life in the London Ghetto, its sordid squalor and rigid ritualism, combined with 
genuine religious faith and enthusiasm. The wretched inhabitants, huddled together 
in misery, and constrained to keep many fasts not prescribed in the calendar, are 
still scrupulous about all the detailed observances of their religion, and bound by a 
remarkable loyalty among themselves. A good example of their subjection to form 
is shown in the rigid but kindly Reb Shemuel, who would give the coat off his back to 
help a needy Jew, and yet could ruin his daughter's whole life on account of an unimportant text in the Torah. The second part, 'Grandchildren of the Ghetto,' 
develops some of the characters who are children in the earlier portion, and also 
introduces us to the Jew who has acquired wealth and culture, while retaining his 
race characteristics. This division of the book deals rather with the problems of 
Judaism, both of the race and of individuals. It shows the effects of culture on different types of mind, and gives us the noble aspiration of Raphael Leon, the profound 
discontent of Esther, the fanatical zeal and revolt of Strelitski, and the formalism 
of the Goldsmiths, serving merely as a cloak for their ambition. There are many 
touches of the author's characteristic wit and irony. He tells of the woman "who

wealthy Jews say with apparent unconsciousness, that they are obliged to abandon

  <summary author="Sienkiewicz, Henryk (1846-1916)" title="Children of the Soil" print_title="Children of the Soil">CHILDREN OF THE SOIL, a novel of modern Polish life, by Henryk Sienkiewicz 
(1894). The plot centres itself in the career of Pan Stanislas Polanyetski, a 
man of wealth and education, who at the age of thirty "wanted to many, and 
was convinced that he ought to marry." The story opens with his business visit 
to the estate of Kremen, on which he has a claim, the home of a relative, Pan 
Plaritski, and his daughter Maryina. He falls in love with Maryina; but the refusal 
of her father to pay his debt to Polanyetski causes misunderstanding between the 
latter and the young girl, and they are alienated for the time being. Their reconciliation and marriage are brought about by a little invalid girl, Litka, who loves them 
both, and who wishes to see them happy. After his marriage, Polanyetski conceives 
an unworthy attachment for the wife of Ms friend Mashko, but finally overcomes 
temptation. The book closes upon his happiness with his wife and child. There 
are interesting side issues to the story, involving questions of property, of the social 
order, of marriage. The work as a whole, although realistic, is sane in spirit, genial 
and broad in its conception of lif e and character. Maryina is one of the most finished 
of Sienkiewicz's types of noble women. </summary>
  <summary author="Heyse, Paul (1830-1914)" title="The Children of the World" print_title="The Children of the World">CHILDREN OF THE WORLD, by Paul Heyse (1873), obtained immediate 
popularity, and caused great controversy over the fearless treatment of the theme. 
The children of the world are represented by a young doctor of philosophy, a strong, 
well-balanced character; his younger brother, an almost Christlike idealist; and 
their circle of friends and fellow-students, who, in spite of mistakes and eccentricities, 
bear the stamp of true nobility of soul. They are all either on the road to, or have 
already reached, what the children of God are pleased to call unbelief. In the portraiture of the differing camps there are no sharp contrasts, no unfair caricaturing, 
but an impartiality, a blending of one into the other, that makes one of the strongest 
claims of the book to attention.</summary>
  <summary author="Allen, James Lane (1849-1925)" title="The Choir Invisible" print_title="The Choir Invisible">CHOIR INVISIBLE, THE, by James Lane Allen, appeared in 1897, and is one of Allen's 
most popular and pleasing stories. It was enlarged from an earlier story called 
'John Gray.' Its scene is the Kentucky of a hundred years ago. The hero is John 
Gray, a schoolmaster and idealist, who, disappointed in his love for Amy Falconer, a 
pert, pretty, shallow flirt, gradually comes to care for Mrs. Falconer, her aunt, a 
noble woman in reduced circumstances, who with her husband has left a former 
stately home in Virginia and come to live in the Kentucky wilderness. She loves 
him in return with a deep, tender passion that has in it something of the motherly 
instinct of protection; but, her husband being alive, she conceals her feeling from 
Gray until after he has departed from Lexington and settled in another State. She 
then writes him to say she is free and he replies that he is married. But he tells her 
in a final letter that she has remained his ideal and guiding star to noble action. 
The romantic atmosphere and the ideal cast of these two leading characters make the 
fiction very attractive; and the fresh picturesque descriptions of pioneer life in 
Kentucky give the tale historical value.</summary>
  <summary author="Balzac, Honoré de (1799-1850)" title="The Chouans" print_title="The Chouans">CHOUANS, THE, by Balzac. This was the novelist's first important work. The 
title, when it appeared in 1829, was 'The Last Chouan: or, Bretagne in 1800.' In 
1846 it was rearranged in its present form. It is the story of a young girl, Marie de 
Verneuil, sent by Fouche* to entrap the leader of the royalists in Bretagne, the Marquis 
de Montauran. She falls in love with him, reveals her disgraceful mission, and 
devotes all her energies to save him, until a trick of his enemies leads her to believe 
him false. Then she plots his ruin, is undeceived too late; and both die together. 
Marie is an exquisite creation, revealing that deep and intuitive knowledge of the 
soul of woman of which Balzac was to give so many proofs afterward. Montauran 
also is an original character, vigorously and delicately drawn. In Hulot, the rough 
republican commandant sprung from the ranks, and in Marche-a-Terre, the ferocious 
but honest fanatic, we have two of Balzac's "types," designed and classified truthfully and convincingly. Many of the scenes are of tragic intensity. Nothing could 
be more terrible than that of the massacre of the Blues at Vivetiere, that of the unmasking of the spy among her enemies, or that of the roasting of the old miser by the 
Chouans to compel him to reveal his treasure. The description of a mass said by a 
priest in rags, in the midst of the forest, before a granite altar, while the insurgents, 
kneeling near their guns, beat their breasts and repeat the responses, is singularly 
grand and imposing. The author made a profound study of the scenery of Bretagne, 
and the manners of its people, before he wrote his romance; and his pictures of both 
scenery and people have the stamp of reality and truth.</summary>
  <summary author="Caine, Hall, Sir (1853-1931)" title="The Christian: A Story" print_title="The Christian:\nA Story">CHRISTIAN, THE, by Hall Caine (1897), is a popular romance. For the most 
part the scene is laid in London. The main characters are Glory Quayle, the 
granddaughter of a Manx clergyman, and John Storm, the son of a nobleman and 
nephew of the prime minister. Glory has actor's blood in her veins; John is a religious 
enthusiast whom his father, disappointed in his choice of life, disinherits. The girl 
goes to London as a hospital nurse; the man, as assistant clergyman of a fashionable 
church. But she is soon tired of a life she is unfitted for, and longs for pleasure, 
change, excitement; while he is sickened at the worldliness, fraud, and pretense of 
West End piety, and resigns his position to join a monastic brotherhood, finding, 
however, after a year of trial, that the ascetic retirement from the world is not the 
true religious ideal for him. The thought, too, of Glory mingles ever subtly with 
the thought of God. Meanwhile, she has had some hard knocks in the struggle to 
get on the stage and show her unusual powers. She becomes a music-hall singer, to 
John's great distress, and for a long while he keeps away from her and her fashionable 
friends. But his desire to save Glory's soul and to win the girl herself leads 
him to a declaration, and he finds he is loved in return; but she is unwilling to give 
up her profession and associate herself with him in his work. She makes a brilliant 
d6but as a star on the regular stage. Father Storm breaks down as a hermit and a 
crusading Christian, and ends in failure. The details of London life are spectacular, 
and the object of the book seems to be to show the inadequacy of London churches to 
save the city. </summary>

who loves his cousin Lady Barbara, but is rejected because of his lack of energy and 
his aimlessness in life. He grows pale and listless; a doctor is called in, and prescribes

pathetic and humorous, abounds in vivid and dramatic scenes of Scotch life by the

her noble heart, is a heroine worth while. Reade's wit and humor permeate the book, 
and his vigorous ethics make it a moral tonic. </summary>
  <summary author="Charles, Elizabeth Rundle (1828-1896)" title="Chronicles of the Schonberg-Cotta Family" print_title="Chronicles\nof the\nSchonberg-Cotta Family">CHRONICLES OF THE SCHONBERG-COTTA FAMILY, by Mrs. Elizabeth 
Charles (1863). These chronicles, dealing with the period of the Reformation in Germany, are written chiefly by Friedrich and Else, the eldest children of the Schonberg-Cotta family. Their father is an improvident printer with eight children to provide 
for. Martin Luther, adopted by their aunt Ursula Cotta, is prominent throughout. 
The chronicles open with the efforts of Friedrich and Else to understand the Romanist 
religious life, and their brave efforts to hold the family together. The family, which 
is very religious, sends the eldest son, Friedrich, to the University of Erfurt, where 
Luther has already shown great promise. In fulfillment of vows, Luther and Friedrich next enter an Augustinian monastery, where they struggle hard to destroy their 
worldly ties, Friedrich being especially beset on account of his love for a young girl 
named Eva. Rising rapidly, the two friends are intrusted with a mission to Rome. 
The lives of the easy-going monks distress them; finally the selling of indulgences 
brings Luther to outspoken denunciation of the abuses of the Church. In this 
Friedrich supports him, and both are excommunicated and thrown into prison. 
Luther escapes, and appeals to the people with his new doctrine that personal responsibility to God is direct, without mediation of priests. This teaching is proclaimed 
broadcast, and Luther becomes an object of fear to Rome; but he lives to the age 
of sixty-three, and dies a happy father and husband, having espoused Catherine 
von Bora, a former nun. Friedrich, after many hindrances, marries Eva. The book 
is written with an effort after the archaic style, and has much of the simplicity and 
directness of the old chronicles. Its point of view is that of evangelical Protestantism, 
and it lacks the judicial spirit that would have presented a true picture of the time. 
It is interesting, however, and has proved a very great favorite, though accurate 
scholarship finds fault with its history.</summary>
  <summary author="Churchill, Winston (1874-1965)" title="Lord Randolph Churchill" print_title="Lord Randolph Churchill">CHURCHILL, LORD RANDOLPH, by Winston Churchill (1906). The life of 
Lord Randolph Churchill by his son is one of the foremost of English political biographies. With the exception of the first two chapters and the last, the events which 
it describes are included within the stormy period between 1880 and 1890. Lord 
Randolph had no long years of office to his credit, no great legislation called by his 
name, no easily tabulated list of achievements, yet his forceful and magnetic personality exercised an extraordinary influence upon the Conservative party when it 
was in danger of being overwhelmed by Gladstone. He was a leader of that progressive variety of English Conservatism which came to be known as Tory Democracy, urging the Conservatives to adopt popular reforms and to dispute the claim of 
Liberals to be the only true champions of the working classes. Although he had much 
sympathy with Ireland, he was a bitter opponent of Gladstone's Home Rule proposals of 1885. The great force which he was just beginning to exercise on British 
politics was broken by his death at the comparatively early age of forty-six, yet he 
has a secure place in English political history, for, in the words with which his 
biographer closes, "there is an England which stretches far beyond the well-drilled 
masses who are assembled by party machinery to salute with appropriate acclamation 
the utterances of their recognized fuglemen; an England of wise men who gaze without 
self-deception at the failings and follies of both political parties; of brave and earnest 
men who find In neither faction fair scope for the effort that is in them; of 'poor men ' 
who increasingly doubt the sincerity of parry philanthropy. It was to that England 
that Lord Randolph Churchill appealed; it was that England he so nearly won; it is 
by that England he will be justly judged." </summary>
  <summary author="Anonymous" title="The Lay of the Cid" print_title="The Lay of the Cid">CID, THE ('Poema del Cid,' 'Cantares del Cid,' or 'Gesta de myo Cid'), a popular 
epic poem of the twelfth century, narrating in long assonant couplets, events real 
and legendary from the life of a Castilian noble, Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (d. 1099), who 
was exiled by the king of Leon-Castile and thenceforward lived as an independent 
chieftain, in alliance now with Christian and now with Moorish princes. The name 
Cid, or Lord, was given to him by the Arabs. The poem describes the Cid's exile, his 
campaign against the Moors, his capture of Valencia (1094), an d the'marriage of his 
daughters, first to the Infantes of Carrion, who insult them, and then to the Infantes 
of Navarre and Arragon. A second poem, the 'Cronaca Rimada del Cid' Cantar de 
Rodrigo/ or 'Leyenda de las Mocedades de Rodrigo' relates his enfances or first 
exploits his slaying of his father's enemy, Count Gomez, and his marriage to 
Jimena, daughter of Gomez. The exploits of the Cid are also celebrated in the later 
Romances or ballads (c. 1500). As a specimen of the epic of the people, as a direct, 
vigorous narrative, and as a revelation of mediaeval Spain, this poetry has great 
importance. For a full account, see the LIBRARY under 'The Cid.'</summary>
  <summary author="Corneille, Pierre (1606-1684)" title="The Cid" print_title="The Cid">CID, THE, a drama by Pierre Corneille, first performed in 1636. It is closely 
modeled on a Spanish play by Guillem de Castro (1569-1631) 'Las Mocedades del 
Cid' i.e., 'The Youth of the Cid,' a romantic treatment of the mediaeval poem on that 
subject. The play presents Corneille's favorite theme of the strong character faced 
by conflicting duties. Don Rodrigue loves Chimene but is bound by filial duty to 
kill her father, Don Gomes, for insulting his father, Don Diegue. Chimene, who 
reciprocates the love of Don Rodrigue, is now equally bound to enmity against him. 
She refuses to take his life when he gives her the opportunity; but although he rescues the city of Seville from the Moors she feels obliged to demand of the king a 
champion against him. Nevertheless her distress at the supposed victory of this 
champion Don Sanche, a rival suitor, reveals her true feelings; and by tne command 
of the king she weds the real victor, Don Rodrigue. The character of the Infanta, 
who also loves the hero, but suppresses this emotion in deference to her duty to 
Chimene and to the king, is another example of the strong-willed personages so typical 
of Corneille. Though romantic in theme the play, by its observance of the unities 
and of stage decorum, initiated the reign of classicism in the French drama.</summary>
  <summary author="Vigny, Alfred de (1797-1863)" title="Cinq Mars" print_title="Cinq Mars">CINQ-MARS, by Alfred de Vigny (1826). The subject of this historical romance is 
the conspiracy of Cinq-Mars and De Thou against Richelieu, its detection, and the 
execution of the offenders at Lyons in 1 642 . The work is modeled after the Waverley 
novels. All the action centres around the great figure of Richelieu. The aristocratic 
prejudices of the author prevent him from doing full justice, perhaps, to the statesman who curbed the power of the French noblesse; and many critics think that Bulwer 
depicts him more truly. The Richelieu of De Vigny is Richelieu as he appeared to 
the courtiers of the time: the organizer of assassination and espionage, in conjunction 
with Father Joseph and Laubardemont, Richelieu in his days of hatred and murder. 
The author is more just to the Cardinal when he shows him making successful efforts 
to place France at the head of Europe, preparing and winning victories, and sending 
his king to fight like an obscure captain. The character of Louis XIII. is finely 
drawn, and we have a lifelike and admirably colored portrait of that strange and 
gloomy monarch, who is the master of France and the slave of Richelieu, and who 
sends his most devoted friends to the scaffold at the bidding of the man he hates. 
Indeed, the contrast between the obedient monarch and his imperious servant is the 
most striking feature in the romance. There are many scenes of great historic 
value; as for instance, that in which Richelieu retires on the King's refusal to sign a 
death- warrant, and abandons Louis to himself. The presentation of Cinq-Mars is 
also very vivid: we have a Cinq-Mars, who, if not true to history, is at least true to 
human nature. The outline of De Thou is perhaps just a little shadowy.</summary>

lodgers. The financial hopes of the family are based on a large tract of land called 
"Clark's Field," in the centre of a manufacturing town, adjacent to the city of B. 
(presumably Boston), which they have owned for several generations but have been 
unable to realize upon. When Ardelle is fourteen the property is sold, and her uncle 
and aunt having died, she becomes sole heir to a fortune which amounts later to 
several million dollars. Being a minor, Ardelle becomes a ward of the Washington 
Trust Co. and is sent to a fashionable school and later to Paris. Here she meets an 
impecunious and worthless young art-student from California named Archie Davis, 
and marries him much to the disapproval of her guardians. Ardelle and her husband 
drift aimlessly about leading an idle, useless existence until the former attains her 
majority, when they return to America and take possession of the five million dollars 
awaiting them. This they proceed to waste in every conceivable way, settling 
eventually in California where they build a palatial residence. Ardelle has a son on 
whom she lavishes the affection she once felt for Archie, who, now, through weakness 
and dissipation, has alienated her love. Among the workmen on the place is a young 
mason named Tom Clark who proves to be a long-lost cousin of Ardelle and presumably an equal heir to the property. Ardelle decides not to acquaint Tom with this 
knowledge but the moment arrives when he makes a heroic attempt to save her 
child from a burning house, and though the child is dead, Ardelle insists he shall share 
her fortune. She parts finally with Archie and returns East to inform the Trust Co. 
of her decision. She finds complications awaiting her as the property so long unclaimed by the lost heirs stands irrevocably in her name. Nevertheless she is able to 
compensate Tom according to her desire, and decides with his assistance to use her 
money for the welfare and uplift of the poor people who live in the tenements built 
upon Clark's Field.</summary>

Clayhanger, of Bursley, is a fifteen-year-old lad just leaving school. His ambition 
to become an architect is overridden by his stern father, Darius Clayhanger, who 
insists on his going into the family printing business. Though Edwin proves invaluable, Darius refuses to pay him more than a pittance. Edwin's love for art and 
literature is stimulated through Mr. Orgreave, a Bursley architect, and he finds a 
congenial companion in Mr. Orgreave's charming daughter, Janet, through whom he 
'comes to know Hilda Lessways, an odd girl who comes down from Brighton on a 
visit. Edwin and Hilda are mutually attracted, because she has an interesting mind 
which runs parallel to his, but when he informs his father of his intention to marry 
her, Darius refuses to pay his son more than a pound a week. But Edwin is saved 
the embarrassment of trying to establish a home on that amount by the startling 
news that Hilda has married a Mr. Cannon. Edwin is heartbroken. He cannot 
return Janet's affection because he is still devoted to the faithless Hilda. When Hilda 
sends her little son, George Edwin, down to visit "aunt" Janet, Edwin and the boy 
become inseparable companions, and when Edwin finally succeeds in getting Hilda's 
address he hurries to Brighton to see his old love. He arrives just in time to save 
Hilda's furniture from being attached for debt, and he gives her enough money to 
tide her over; he learns from her that the marriage with Cannon was forced upon her; 
that Cannon is now in prison for bigamy and that her marriage to him is void. 
Edwin returns to Bursley, considerably comforted. Little George's illness in Bursley 
brings Hilda down from Brighton in hot haste. Edwin stays with Hilda until the 
child is well out of danger. Then he goes home to trouble of his own. Darius Clayhanger suffers a shock, and softening of the brain follows. Always hard to manage, 
Darius becomes exceedingly difficult in his last illness. The dictatorial old man 
suffers keenly when he has to give over entire charge of the business to Edwin, 
including the keys, and the power of signing checks. The illness and death of Darius 
are described in Bennett's most masterly style, and the reader is left to look forward 
to the marriage of Hilda and Edwin. 

The sequel, 'Hilda Lessways,' tells the story again from Hilda's point of view, 
clearing up the mystery of her marriage to Cannon, in which she was the victim 
partly of circumstances, partly of her own ardent and erratic temperament. 'These 
Twain,' which completes the trilogy, recounts Edwin's success in the printing business and his married life witn Hilda and her son George. Some of the minor characters are admirable studies in Bennett's realistic manner.</summary>

romances, presents a vigorous picture of Egypt under the rule of the wonderful Queen. 
Hannachis, priest and magician, descendant of the Pharaohs, tells his own story. 
Certain nobles, hating the Greek Cleopatra and her dealings with Rome, plot to 
overthrow her, and seat Harmachis on her throne. He enters her service to kill 
her when the revolt is ripe, but falls in love with her and cannot strike. Following 
this complication come plot and counterplot, treason and detection, private 
griefs and hates that overthrow empires, and the later tragedy of Cleopatra's stormy 
life; more than one historic figure adding dignity and verisimilitude to the tale. The 
plot is well managed, and the interest maintained. The book is written in a curiously artificial manner, carefully studied. It contains many dramatic passages, 
with now and then an unexpected reminiscence of the manner of 'King Solomon's 
Mines' and 'She'; while its pages are crowded with gorgeous pictures of the splendid 
material civilization of Egypt.</summary>

It would be hard to prove that the conventional Yankee, as he is commonly understood, did not exist before Judge Haliburton 
published his account of that impossible person; yet no other book has so widely 
spread before the world the supposed characteristics of the typical New-Englander. 
Sam Slick, first presented to the public in a series of letters in the Nova-Scotian, 
in 1835, appeared two years later in a volume. The author was then but forty-three, 
although for eight years he had been chief justice of the court of Common Pleas. 
Having the interests of his province greatly at heart, he invented the clever clockmaker less to satirize the Yankees than to goad the Nova-Scotians to a higher sense of 
what they might accomplish politically and economically. To carry out his plan, he 
imagined a Nova-Scotian riding across country on a fast horse, and meeting Slick, 
the peddler, bound on a clock-selling expedition. The Yankee horse proves the faster, 
while his owner, in spite of an unattractive exterior, shows himself a man of wit. 
The peddler, with his knowledge of human nature and his liberal use of "soft sawder, " 
is more than a match for the natives he has dealings with. Thus two birds are hit 
by Judge Haliburton with one stone. The average Yankee is satirized in the grotesque personality of the peddler, and the Nova-Scotians are lashed for their short-sightedness and lack of energy. The fund of anecdote and keen wit displayed in this 
book won it many Admirers on both sides of the line. Either the Npva-Scotians as a 
whole did not feel hurt by its hits at themselves, or they found consolation in the 
picture presented of the sharp-bargaining, boastful Yankee. The Yankee enjoyed
its humor without being bored by its local politics, and most readers made allowance 
for its intentional caricature. The later chronicles of Sam Slick, including 'The 
Attache; or Sam Slick in England,' met with less success than the first. </summary>

The masterpiece of this vigorous novelist recreates the fifteenth century, and presents to modern eyes the Holland, Germany, France, and Italy of the Middle Ages, as they 
appeared to mediaeval people. The hero of the story is Gerard, son of a Tergouw 
mercer; a studious sweet-natured lad, strongly artistic in bent, but designed for the 
Church, where a good benefice is promised him. He falls in love with Margaret 
Brandt, the daughter of a poor scholar, and giving up the Church career, betroths 
himself to her; and is on the eve of marriage when his irate father imprisons him in the 
stadthuys for disobedience, as a mediaeval parent has power to do. From this point 
the story ceases to be a simple domestic tale, and becomes a record of swift adventure 
in Holland, Germany, and Italy. Then follows a most touching tale of betrayed 
affection, of noble womanly patience and heroism; and through all, a vivid and 
thrilling portrayal of the awful power of the mediaeval Church. Scene crowds on 
scene, and incident on incident, aflame with the imagination of the romancer. The 
dramatic quality of the story, its vivid descriptive passages, the force and individuality impressed on its dialogue, its virile conception of the picturesque brutality 
and the lofty spirituality of the age it deals with, the unfailing brilliancy of the 
novelist's treatment of his theme, and its humorous quaintness, place 'The Cloister

of fiction by that prolific moralist of a past era. It was written after she had 
passed her sixtieth year, and was intended as an antidote to what she considered the 
deleterious influence of the romantic tales of that day. In 'Ccelebs' she sought to 
convey precepts of religion, morals, and manners, in the form of a novel. Ccelebs, 
a young gentleman of fortune and estate in the north of England, sets out to find a 
woman who shall meet the somewhat exacting requirements of his departed mother. 
This estimable matron held that "the education of the present race of females is not 
very favorable to domestic happiness. " His dying father had also enjoined Ccelebs 
to take the advice of an old friend, Mr. Stanley, before marrying. Ccelebs goes to 
Stanley Grove in Hampshire, taking London on his way, and meeting at the house of 
Sir JohnBedfield several fashionable women who fail to reach his standard of eligibility. 
At Stanley Grove he finds his ideal in one of the six daughters of the house, Lucilla, 
with whom he dutifully falls in love, to be at once accepted. In the month of his 
probation he meets Dr. Barlow, rector of the parish; Lady Ash ton, a gloomy religionist; the Carltons, a dissolute and unbelieving husband who is converted by a 
saintly wife; and Tyrril, holding the Antinomian doctrine of faith without works, 
whose foil is Flam, a Tory squire, simple in faith and practicing good works. The 
conversation of these and other personages supplies the didactic features of the novel. 
'Calebs' was published in London in 1808, and had an instant and great popularity.

Luciana dwells with her. By chance the Syracusan Antipholus and his Dromio are 
at this time in Ephesus. The mother Emilia is abbess of a priory in the town. 
Through a labyrinth of errors they all finally discover each other. Antipholus of 
Syracuse sends his Dromio to the inn with a bag of gold, and presently meets Dromio 
of Ephesus, who mistaking him, urges him to come at once to dinner: his wife and 
sister are waiting. In no mood for joking, he beats his supposed servant. The other 
Dromio also gets a beating for denying that he had just talked about dinner and wife. 
In the meantime, Adriana and her sister meet the Syracusans on the street, and 
amaze them by their reproaches. As in a dream the men follow them home, and 
Dromio of Syracuse is bid keep the door. Now comes home the rightful owner with 
guests, and knocks in vain for admittance. So he goes off in a rage to an inn to dine. 
At his home the coil thickens. There Antipholus of Syracuse makes love to Luciana, 
and downstairs the amazed Dromio of Syracuse flies from the greasy kitchen wench 
who claims him as her own. Master and man finally resolve to set sail at once from 
this place of enchantment. After a great many more laughable puzzles and contretemps, comes Adriana, with an exerciser Doctor Pinch and others, who bind her husband and servant as madmen and send them away. Presently enter the bewildered 
Syracusans with drawn swords, and away flies Adriana, crying, "They are loose 
again!" The Syracusans take refuge in the abbey. Along comes the duke leading 
Egeon to execution. Meantime the real husband and slave have really broken 
loose, bound Doctor Pinch, singed off his beard, and nicked his hair with scissors. 
At last both pairs of twins meet face to face, and Egeon and Emilia solve all puzzles.</summary>
  <summary author="Lytton, Edward Bulwer Lytton, Baron (1803-1873)" title="The Coming Race" print_title="The Coming Race">COMING RACE, THE, by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. This is a race of imaginary 
beings, called Vrilya or Ana, who inhabit an imaginary world placed in a mysterious 
subterranean region. They have outstripped us by many centuries in scientific 
acquirements; making the great discovery of a force, " vril, " of which all other forces 
are but modifications. They possess perpetual light; they can fly; and produce all 
the phenomena of personal magnetism. They have no laboring class, which has been 
superseded by machinery; there is absolute social equality; the ruler merely looks after 
a few necessary details. Intelligence supersedes force. Women are superior to men, 
their greater power over the force "vril" giving them greater physical and intellectual ability; still the more emotional and affectionate sex, in courtship they take the 
initiative; they are second to men only in practical science. In philosophy and religion there is unanimity: all believe in God and immortality. The discoverer of this 
kingdom is a New-Yorker, who tries to entertain his hosts with a eulogy on the American democracy; but this form of government, he learns, is called Koom-Bosh (Government of the Ignorant) in the Vrilya language. The finding of this new world gives 
rise to many speculations on human destiny. The entire devotion of these wonderful 
beings to science means the disappearance of all the arts. There are no great novels 
or poems or musical compositions. There are no criminals and no heroes. Life 
has lost its evils, and with them all that is worth struggling for. Everything is 
reduced to a dead level; everywhere ennui seems to reign supreme. This story, 
published in 1871, was a skit on certain assumptions of science; but its cleverness of 
invention and brilliancy of treatment, added to the craving wonder of humanity 
as to what its evolution is to be toward, gave it a large popularity.</summary>
  <summary author="Walton, Izaak (1593-1683)" title="The Complete Angler" print_title="The Complete Angler">COMPLETE ANGLER, THE, or, CONTEMPLATIVE MAN'S RECREATION: being 'A 
Discourse on Rivers, Fish-Ponds, Fish, and Fishing'; by Izaak Walton and Charles 
Cotton. The 'Complete Angler,' which was first published in England in 1653, 
was designed primarily by its author to teach the art of angling, of which long experience with hook and line had made him master. The book is written in dialogue 
form, and is filled with conversations touching the theme in question, which are 
carried on by an angler, a hunter, a falconer, a milkmaid, and others. In this way 
observations are made regarding the various kinds of fish, their habits, whereabouts, 
and the best methods of securing them, with endless details and minute descriptions 
of the ways and means necessary to the success of this sport. The book is distinguished by a pastoral simplicity, is admirable in style, and is filled with fine descriptions of rural scenery. It is moreover interspersed with many charming lyrics, old 
songs and ballads, among them the 'Song of the Milkmaid.' It is attributed to 
Christopher Marlowe, and begins: 

    "Come live with me, and be my love, 
    And we will all the pleasures prove, 
    That valleys, groves, or hills, or field, 
    Or woods and steepy mountains yield."

The 'Angler' is not alone devoted to sport, but is filled with precepts which recommend the practice of religion and the exercise of patience, humility, contentment, 
and other virtues. Before the publication of this book, rules and directions for angling had been handed down from age to age chiefly by tradition, having only in a few 
instances been set down in writing. Whether considered as a treatise on the art of 
angling, or as a delightful pastoral filled with charming descriptions of rural scenery, 
'The Complete Angler* ranks among English classics. In 1676, when Walton was 
eighty-two and was preparing a fifth edition for the press, Charles Cotton, also a 
famous angler, and an adopted son of Walton's, wrote a second part for the book, 
which is a valuable supplement. It is written in imitation of the style and discourses 
of the original, upon "angling for trout or grayling in a clear stream." Walton, 
though an expert angler, knew but little of fly-fishing, and so welcomed Cotton's 
supplement, which has since that time been received as a part of his book. Walton
is called the "Father of all Anglers"; indeed, there has been hardly a writer upon 
the subject since his time who has not made use of his rules and practice. </summary>
  <summary author="Morley, John (1838-1923)" title="On Compromise" print_title="On Compromise">COMPROMISE, ON, by John Morley (1874). The problem of this book is stated 
by its author. The right of thinking freely and acting independently, of using our 
minds without excessive awe of authority, and shaping our lives without unquestioning obedience to custom, is now a finally accepted principle in some sense or other 
with every school of thought that has the smallest chance of commanding the future. 
Under what circumstances does the exercise and vindication of the right, thus 
conceded in theory, become a positive duty in practice? It is his opinion that the 
general mental climate, outside the domain of physical science, has ceased to be 
invigorating and encourages an already existing tendency "to acquiesce in a lazy 
accommodation with error, an ignoble economy of truth, and a vicious compromise 
of the permanent gains of adhering to a sound general principle, for the sake of the 
temporary gains of departing from it." He discusses, therefore, the causes of this 
tendency, the influence of French examples, the increase in the power of the press, 
the growth of material prosperity, the sway exercised by a State Church. In later 
chapters he deals at large with individual intellectual responsibility in the sphere of 
politics and religion and concludes with an examination of the means by which 
opinion may be realized. What is most needed is a firm faith in the self-protecting 
quality and stability of society which will not be shattered by the firmness and 
sincerity of lovers of truth." It is better to wait and to defer the realization of our 
ideas until we can realize them fully, than to defraud the future by truncating them, if 
truncate them we must in order to secure a partial triumph for them in the immediate 
present."</summary>
  <summary author="Burke, Edmund (1729-1797)" title="Conciliation with America" print_title="Conciliation with America">CONCILIATION; WITH THE AMERICAN COLONIES, SPEECH ON, by Edmund 
Burke, was delivered March 22, 1775, in submitting a set of resolutions affirming the 
principle of autonomy for the American colonies with the view of preventing their 
defection. Emphasizing the gravity of the crisis and the desirability of a peace based 
on a restoration of confidence and not on conquest, Burke inquires first into the desirability of concession to the colonies and then into the nature of the proposed concession. Taking up the first question and following his usual method of going to the
heart of a subject, he makes a brilliant analysis of the American point of view. Owing 
to their growing population, their expanding commerce, agriculture, and fisheries, 
the wise neglect by which England has left them to develop these resources, their 
English descent, the Puritanism of the New Englanders and the sJaveholding of the 
Southerners, the prevalence of lawyers and litigation, and their distance from the 
mother country, the American people are filled with a fierce spirit of liberty. Should 
this state of mind be changed as inconvenient, prosecuted as criminal, or complied 
with as necessary? It cannot be changed, because the causes just enumerated are 
inalterable: population and wealth cannot be checked or the national temper broken. 
To prosecute it as criminal is impossible; one cannot indict a whole people, and force 
only begets further resistance. It remains to comply with it as necessary, in other 
words to make concessions. As to the nature of these concessions, they should 
meet the Americans' desire by giving them an interest in the constitution. To obtain 
a people's good- will is more prudent than to insist on abstract rights over them. As 
Ireland and Wales were contented by the granting of representative government, so 
will America be contented if allowed to raise all taxes by free grant and not by imposition. After denouncing the principle of coercion and of barter in colonial relations, Burke ends by exalting the ties of common descent, common institutions, and 
common sentiment as the strongest links of empire. Though the cogency of Burke's 
arguments and the depth of his political wisdom were as usual ignored by the House 
of Commons and his resolutions were defeated 270 to 78, his speech remains a final 
pronouncement of the true principles of colonial government.</summary>

novel of which no authorized Swedish edition has ever appeared. Written in French, 
it appeared first in German in 1893. The suffering and the torture which one personality can inflict upon another awakens the sympathy of the reader, and explains 
the author's attitude toward women in his writings. The hero's friendship with the 
pretty Baroness Marie began in her husband's home, where he was a welcome guest. 
He comes to adore her, and decides to flee from temptation. He actually embarks on 
a steamer for France, but, unable to endure the loneliness of the voyage and the 
thought of the separation, he returns on the pilot-boat. The baroness wishes to go 
on the stage, and makes this the public excuse for the divorce from her husband. 
After they are married he alternately loves and hates her. He makes several vain 
attempts to escape from the physical obsession she has for him. It is a frank, almost 
pathological description of the struggle which the intellectual man makes to free 
himself from the slavery of passionate love for this worthless woman, who finally 
drives him to madness. The most painful details are given concerning the relation of 
husband and wife. It is not a book which can be recommended to young readers or 
indeed to any whose nerves and intellectual digestion are not unusually strong.</summary>
  <summary author="Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1712-1778)" title="Confessions" print_title="Confessions">CONFESSIONS, by Jean Jacques Rousseau. The 'Confessions' of Rousseau were 
written during the six most agitated years of his life, from 1765 to 1770; and his state 
of health at this time, both mental and bodily, may account for some of the peculiarities of this famous work. The first six books were not published until 1781, and 
the second six not until 1788. According to more than one critic, the 'Confessions,' 
however charming as literature, are to be taken as documentary evidence with great 
reserve. They form practically a complete life of Rousseau from his earliest years, 
in which he discloses not only all his own weaknesses, but the faults of those who had 
been his friends and intimates. In the matter of his many love affairs he is unnecesarily frank, and his giving not only details but names has been severely condemned. 
The case is all the worse, if, as has been supposed, these love affairs are largely imaginary. As the first half of the ' Confessions ' is, in the main, a romance with picturesque 
embellishments, the second half has little more foundation in fact, with its undue 
melancholy and its stories of imaginary spies and enemies. In the matter of style, the 
1 Confessions ' leaves little to be desired, in this respect surpassing many of Rousseau's 
earlier works. It abounds in fine descriptions of nature, in pleasing accounts of rural 
life, and in interesting anecdotes of the peasantry. The influence of the ' Confessions,' 
unlike that of Rousseau's earlier works, was not political nor moral, but literary. He 
may be called from this work the father of French Romantisme. Among those who 
acknowledged his influence were Bernardin de St. Pierre, Chateaubriand, George 
Sand, and the various authors who themselves indulged in confessions of their own, 
like De Musset, Vigny, Hugo, Lamartine, and Madame de Stael, as well as many in 
Germany, England, and other countries.</summary>

These Confessions, first published in the London Magazine during 1821, start with 
the plain narrative of how his approach to starvation when a runaway schoolboy, 
wandering about in Wales and afterwards in London, brought on the chronic ailment 
whose relief De Quincey found in opium-eating; and how he at times indulged in the 
drug for its pleasurable effects, "but struggled against this fascinating enthrallment 
with a religious zeal . . . and untwisted, almost to its final links, the accursed chain." 
Then follow nightmare experiences, with a certain Malay who reappeared to trouble 
him from time to time, in the opium dreams; and also with a young woman, Arm, 
whom he had known in his London life. But the story's chief fascination lies in its 
gorgeous and ecstatic visions or experiences of some transcendental sort, while under 
the influence of the drug; the record of Titanic struggles to get free from it, and the 
pathetic details of sufferings that counterbalanced its delights. 

The 'Confessions of an English Opium-Eater' is one of the most brilliant books 
in literature. As an English critic has said, "It is not opium in De Quincey, but De 
Quincey in opium, that wrote the 'Suspiria' and the 'Confessions.'" All the essays 
are filled with the most unexpected inventions, the most gorgeous imagery, and, 
strange to say, with a certain insistent good sense. As a rhetorician De Quincey 
stands unrivaled.</summary>
  <summary author="Disraeli, Benjamin, Earl of Beaconsfield (1804-1881)" title="Coningsby; Or, The New Generation" print_title="Coningsby;\nOr,\nThe New Generation">CONINGSBY, by Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, published in 1844, when 
Disraeli was thirty-nine years old, was his sixth and most successful novel. In three 
months it had gone through three editions, and 50,000 copies had been sold in England 
and the United States. It was a novel with a purpose: the author himself explained 
that his aim was to elevate the tone of public life, to ascertain the true character of 
political parties, and especially to vindicate the claims of the Tories. Incidentally he 
wished to emphasize the importance of the church in the development of England, 
and he tried to do some justice to the Jews. The story opens in the spring of 1832, 
on frhe very day of the resignation of Lord Grey's ministry. This gives Disraeli a 
good opportunity for a dissertation on the politics of the time, including the call of 
the Duke of Wellington to the ministry. The hero, Coningsby, at this time a lad of 
ten, is visiting his grandfather, the rich and powerful Marquis of Monmouth. The 
latter had disinherited the father of Coningsby for marrying an amiable girl of less 
exalted station than his own. Their orphan son is now entirely dependent on his 
grandfather. Lord Monmouth, though showing little affection for the boy, is generous to him. He sends him to Eton and to Cambridge, and has him often visit him 
at his town-house or his Castle. These visits bring the boy in contact with many 
interesting persons, such as the fascinating Sidonia, in whom Disraeli paints his ideal 
Jew; the Princess Colonna, and her stepdaughter Lucretia, whom the Marquis 
marries: the Duke (who has been identified as the Duke of Rutland); the subservient 
Rigby (in whom John Wilson Croker is supposed to be portrayed), and a host of 
personages of high degree with imposing titles. There are more than threescore 
characters in the book, and part of its popularity came from people's interest in 
identifying them with men and women prominent in English social and political life. 
Sidonia, the brilliant Jew, is said to be either Disraeli himself or Baron Alfred de 
Rothschild. Lucian Gay is Theodore Hook, and Oswald Millbank is W. E. Gladstone. The Marquis of Monmouth is the Marquis of Hertford, and Coningsby 
himself has been variously regarded as a picture of Lord Littleton, Lord Lincoln, or 
George Smythe. 

Some of the charm of Coningsby has passed away with the waning interest in the 
political events which it describes. Its satire, however, is still keen, particularly that 
directed against the Peers.</summary>

author when "doing" Warwick Castle. The two meet again in the evening at the 
Warwick inn; then over pipes and Scotch whisky, the stranger explains that he is 
from Hartford, Connecticut, where he used to be superintendent of an arms factory; 
that one day, in a quarrel with one of his men, he lost consciousness from a blow on 
the head with a crowbar; that when he awoke he found himself in England at the 
time of King Arthur, where he was taken captive by a knight, and conveyed to 
Camelot. Here sleep overpowers the narrator, and he goes to bed; first, however, 
committing to the author's hands a manuscript, wherein sitting down by the fire 
again, he reads the rest of the stranger's adventures. The contact of Connecticut 
Yankeedom with Arthurian chivalry gives rise to strange results. England at the 
time of Arthur was a society in which the church "took it out" of the king, the king 
of the noble, and the noble of the freeman; in which "anybody could kill somebody, 
except the commoner and the slave, these had no privileges"; and in which departure from custom was the one crime that the nation could not commit. Sir 
Lancelot of the Lake, Galahad, Bedivere, Merlin, Guinevere, Arthur himself, etc., 
duly appear; and amidst all the fun and pathos, the courtliness, the sincerity, and the 
stern virtues as well as what seems to us the ridiculousness of the age.</summary>

a son of her own, named Eugene Bantry, whom she idolizes, and in consequence she 
prejudices her husband against his own son and causes him to treat him most unfairly. 
Joe is not even decently clothed and is allowed to run wild, while his stepbrother is

is avoided and disliked by the townspeople, who see only the bad in him. His one 
champion is a girl about his own age named Ariel Tabor, who is poor like himself 
and snubbed by her companions. Ariel's rich uncle dies, making her an heiress, and 
she and ker old grandfather'depart for several years' stay in Paris. Just at this time 
Joe gets himself into trouble and runs away from home. He works his way through 
college and the law school, and becoming a successful lawyer, returns after some years 
to his native town to practise. He is treated rudely and ignored by everybody but 
determines to stay and live down his past. He has always admired Mamie Pike, the

stepbrother Eugene, who is a poor specimen of manhood. Ariel returns from Paris a 
dazzling vision of elegance and beauty and takes the town by storm. She discovers 
how shamefully Joe has been treated and begins at once to try to mend matters. 
She gives Joe charge of her affairs, taking her property out of the hands of Judge' 
Pike, who has administered her uncle's estate. Joe finds that the Judge has been 
dishonest, but deals with him leniently in spite of the outrageous treatment he has 
received from him in the past. After Ariel's return Joe appreciates that she is the 
girl he really loves and he not only wins her for his wife, but, re-instated in the opinion

Of the five books into which this admirable work is divided, the first treats of the 
wonderful civilization of the Incas; the second of the discovery of Peru; the third of 
its conquest; the fourth of the civil wars of the conquerors; and the fifth of the settlement of the country. The first book hardly yields in interest to any of the others, 
describing as it does, on the whole, an unparalleled state of society. In it some of the 
votaries of modern socialism have seen confirmation of the practicability and successful working of their own theory; but Prescott's verdict of the system is that it was 
"the most oppressive, though the mildest, of despotisms." At least it was more
lenient, more refined, and based more upon reason as contrasted with force, than 
was that of the Aztecs. He describes it very fully: the orders of society, the divisions 
of the kingdom, the administration of justice, the revenues, religion, education, 
agriculture, manners, manufactures, architecture, etc. From the necessities of its 
material, the work is more scattered in construction than is the 'History of the 
Conquest of Mexico,' which is usually regarded as the author's most brilliant production. Of the opportunities this afforded, Prescott himself remarks: "The natural 
development of the story ... is precisely what would be prescribed by the severest 
rules of art." The portrait drawn of Pizarro, who is the principal figure in the drama, 
is that of a man brave, energetic, temperate, and though avaricious, extravagant; 
bold in action, yet slow, and at the same time inflexible of resolution; ambitious; 
exceptionally perfidious. An effort is made to counterbalance the tendency to hero-worship and picturesque coloring by the occasional insertion of passages of an opposite 
character.</summary>
  <summary author="Boethius (480-524)" title="The Consolation of Philosophy" print_title="The Consolation of Philosophy">CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY, THE, by Boethius. This work called in 
Latin 'De Consolatione Philosophica' was written in prison just before the author
was put to death in 525 by Theodoric, whose favorite minister he had been before his 
incarceration. It is divided into five books; and has for its object to prove from 
reason the existence of Providence. A woman of lofty mien appears to the prisoner, 
and tells him she is his guardian, Philosophy, come to console him in his misfortunes 
and point out their remedy. Then ensues a dialogue in which are discussed all the 
questions that have troubled humanity: the origin of evil, God's omniscience, man's 
free will, etc. The 'Consolations' are alternately in prose and verse; a method 
afterwards adopted by many authors in imitation of Boethius, who was himself 
influenced by a work of Martianus Capella entitled 'De Nuptiis Philologise et Mercurii.' Most of the verses are suggested by passages in Seneca, then the greatest 
moral authority in the West, outside of Christianity. The success of the work was as 
immense as it was lasting; and it was translated into Greek, Hebrew, German, French, 
and Anglo-Saxon, at an early period. The Anglo-Saxon version was by Alfred the 
Great; and is the oldest monument of importance in Anglo-Saxon prose. It has been 
imitated by Chaucer in the 'Testament of Love,' by James I. of Scotland in the 
'Kinges Quhair,' and by many other distinguished writers. In some sort, it connects 
the period of classic literature with that of the Middle Ages, of which Boethius was 
one of the favorite authors; and in classic purity of style and elevation of thought, is 
fully equal to the works of the philosophers of Greece and Rome, while, at the same 
time, it shows the influence of Christian ideals. "It is," says Gibbon, "a golden 
volume, not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or Tully."</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Coriolanus" print_title="Coriolanus">CORIOLANUS, a powerful drama of Shakespeare's later years (written about 1609).,

too haughty pride of a Roman patrician, generous, brave, filial, but a mere boy in 
discretion, his soul a dynamo always overcharged with a voltage current of scorn 
and rage, and playing out its live lightnings on the least provocation. See his fierce 
temper reflected in his little boy, grinding his teeth as he tears a butterfly to pieces: 
"Oh, I warrant how he mammocked it!" Mark his strength: "Death, that dark 
spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie." "What an arm he has! he turned me about with his 
finger and thumb as one would set up a top." In battle "he was a thing of blood, 
whose every motion was timed with dying cries." In the Volscian war, at the gates 
of Corioli, this Caius Marcius performed such deeds of derring-do that he was nigh 
worshiped; and there he got his addition of 'Coriolanus.' His scorn of the rabble, 
their cowardice, vacillation, dirty faces, and uncleaned teeth, was boundless. The 
patricians were with him: if the plebeians rose in riot, accusing the senatorial party 
of "still cupboarding the viand," but never bearing labor like the rest, Menenius 
could put them down with the apologue of the belly and the members, the belly, 
like the Senate, indeed receiving all, but only to distribute it to the rest. Coriolanus 
goes further, and angers the tribunes by roundly denying the right of the cowardly 
plebs to a distribution of grain in time of scarcity. The tribunes stir up the people 
against him; and when he returns from the war, wearing the oaken garland and 
covered with wounds, and seeks the consulship, they successfully tempt his temper 
by taunts, accuse him of treason, and get him banished by decree. In a towering 
rage he cries, "You common cry of curs, I banish you!" and taking an affecting 
farewell of his wife, and of Volumnia his mother (type of the stern and proud Roman 
matron), he goes disguised to Antium and offers his services against Rome to his 
hitherto mortal foe and rival, Tullus Aufidius. The scene with the servants forms the 
sole piece of humor in the play. But his success leads to his ruin; his old stiff-necked 
arrogance of manner again appears. The eyes of all the admiring Volscians are on
him. Aufidius, now bitterly jealous, regrets his sharing of the command; and when, 
softened by the entreaties of weeping wife and mother, Coriolanus spares Rome and 
returns with the Volscians to Antium, his rival and a band of conspirators "stain all 
their edges" in his blood, and he falls, like the great Julius, the victim of his own 
willful spirit.</summary>

  <summary author="Anonymous" title="Cossack Fairy Tales and Folk Tales" print_title="Cossack Fairy Tales\nand Folk Tales">COSSACK FAIRY TALES. This collection of folk-lore was selected, edited, and 
translated from the Ruthenian by R. Nisbet Bain, and published in 1894. The 
Ruthenian or Cossack language, though proscribed by the Russian government, is 
spoken by more than twenty million people. There are in the original three important collections of folk-tales, from which Mr. Bain has made a representative 
selection for translation. There are, Slavonic scholars maintain, certain elements 
in these stories found in the folklore of no other European people. Among these must be mentioned the magic handkerchief, which causes a bridge across the sea to appear 
before a fugitive, or a forest to spring up in his rear delaying his pursuer. There is 
the magic egg, which produces a herd of cattle when broken; and the magic whip, 
which can expel evil spirits. Many elements and episodes common to other mythologies are found, however. There are, for example, Cossack versions of Cinderella 
and the woman who took her pig to market. One tale of a Tsar expelled by an angel 
is an almost literal rendering of King Robert of Sicily, with Cossack coloring. There 
is a Samson-like hero, who reveals the secret of his strength; and an episode of a man 
in a fish's belly, which resembles Hiawatha and the sturgeon rather than Jonah and 
the whale. 

The serpent figures prominently in these stories; and is generally, though by no 
means invariably, malign, and always represents superior intellectual power. The 
women are frequently treacherous, especially when beguiled by the serpent; but it is 
interesting to notice the number of men who cannot keep a secret. The lower animals 
are always friendly to man, and frequently assist him in performing difficult tasks. 
The whole tenor of the stories is charmingly naive and inconsequent; among the 
vampires and magic fires it is somewhat startling to encounter guns and passports.

  <summary author="Tolstoy, Leo, graf (1828-1910)" title="The Cossacks: A Tale of 1852" print_title="The Cossacks:\nA Tale of 1852">COSSACKS, THE, by Tolstoy (1852). This Russian romance is a series of picturesque studies on the life of the Cossacks of the Terek, rather than a romance. The 
slight love story that runs through it simply serves as an excuse for the author's 
graphic descriptions of strange scenes and strange peoples. The hero, Olenin, is a 
ruined young noble, who, to escape his creditors and begin a new life, enters a sotnia
of Cossacks as ensign. One fine night he leaves Moscow; and at the first station 
on his way, he begins already to dream of battles, glory, and of some divinely beautiful 
but half -savage maiden, whom he will tame and polish. His arrival at the camp of his 
regiment on the Terek gives occasion for a fascinating and most realistic picture of 
the wild races he meets so suddenly. The young ensign falls in at once with his half-savage maiden, a tall, statuesque girl, with red lips, a rose-colored undergarment, and 
a blue jacket, who looks back at him with a frightened air as she runs after the buffalo 
she is trying to milk. As he is lodging with her parents, he sets about taming her 
immediately. But he has a rival, young Lukashka, whose threadbare kaftan and 
bearskin shako had long before captivated the fair Marianka. The love affairs of the 
rivals, whom she treats impartially, although she has already made up her mind, 
go on in the midst of hunting, ambuscade, and battle, which are the real subjects of 
the book. At last Olenin discovers that he is too civilized for Marianka. "Ah!"
he says to himself, "if I were a Cossack like Lukashka, got drunk, stole horses, 
assassinated now and then for a little change, she would understand me, and I should 
be happy. But the cruelty and the sweetness of it is that I understand her and she 
will never understand me." The young Cossack is wounded in battle; and the 
linsign, not displaying much emotion at this calamity, receives a look from Marianka 
that tells him his company is no longer desirable: so he decides to exchange into another sotnia. Tolstoy's pictures of the rough life of the Cossacks have a wonderful 
charm. The story is particularly interesting as showing the first germs of the altruistic philosophy which Tolstoy later developed into a cult of self-renunciation.</summary>
  <summary author="Dumas, Alexandre (1802-1870)" title="The Count of Monte Cristo" print_title="The Count of Monte Cristo">COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, THE, by Alexandre Dumas (1844), is the only novel 
of modern times which the great romancer has written; and it is so widely known that 
"the treasure of Monte Cristo" has passed into a proverb. The story opens in 
Marseilles, in the year 1815, just before the "Hundred Days." Young Edward 
Dantes, the hero, mate of the merchant ship Pharaon, is about to be made her captain and marry his sweetheart, the lovely Catalan Mercedes, when his disappointed 
rivals, one of whom wants the ship and the other the girl, conspire against him, and 
lodge information with the "Procurateur du Roi" that Dantes is a dangerous Bonapartist, and is carrying letters from the Emperor, exiled in Elba, to his supporters. 
Although there is circumstantial evidence against him, the magistrate knows Dantes 
to be innocent; but he has reasons of his own for wanting him out of the way. He 
sends him to the gloomy Chateau of If, a fortress built on a rocky ledge in the sea, 
where he suffers an unmerited captivity of nearly twenty years. He escapes at 
length in a miraculous manner, with the knowledge, confided to him by a supposed 
madman, a fellow prisoner, of an enormous treasure hidden on the barren Island of 
Monte Cristo, off the Italian coast. Dante's discovers the treasure, and starts out 
anew in life, to dazzle the world as the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, with the 
one fixed purpose of avenging himself on his persecutors, all of whom have risen high 
in the world to wealth and honors. He becomes a private Nemesis for the destruction of the rich banker, the honored general, and the distinguished magistrate, each 
of whom his tireless, relentless hand brings low. The first half of the book is a story 
of romantic and exciting adventure; the second is in a different key, sombre and 
unlovely, and not likely to convince anyone that revenge is sweet. But the splendid 
imagination of Dumas transfigures the whole, its intensity persuades the reader that 
the impossible is the actual, and its rush and impetuosity sweep him breathless to the 
end.</summary>

belongs to the series known as 'Scenes from Country Life'; a part of his great cycle 
of fiction, 'The Comedy of Human Life.' It appeared in French in 1833, and in the 
standard English translation by Miss Wormeley in 1887. It is e of Balzac's noblest 
pieces of fiction, presenting beautiful traits of human nature with sympathy and 
power. The scene is laid in a village near Grenoble in France, and the story begins 
with the year 1829. To this village comes Genestas, a noble old soldier who adores 
Napoleon, and believes in the certainty of his return to save France. Under the 
assumed name of Captain Bluteau, he rests from his wounds, and is cared for by Dr. 
Benassis, the country doctor, the central character, and a remarkable study of the 
true physician. He is a sort of Father Bountiful in Grenoble. He treats the poor 
peasants without pay, and dislikes taking money except from the rich. He teaches 
the peasantry how to improve their land, introduces methods of work which make for 
prosperity, suggests new industries, and effects a great change for the bett er in the 
neighborhood; so that in ten years the population is tripled, and comfort and happiness are substituted for poverty and misery. The Doctor lives in an attractive old 
house with two servants, one of whom, Jacquotte, the cook, a scolding, faithful, 
executive, and skillful woman, proud of her culinary ability and devoted to Benassis's 
interest, is one of the most enjoyable personages in the story. The incidents of the 
plot have their explanation in the events of a preceding generation. The novel as a 
whole is one of the simplest of Balzac's, free from over-analysis of character and 
motive.</summary>

seat of Worsted Skeynes, young George Pendyce falls in love with Helen Bellew, a 
pretty woman who is separated from her husband, but not divorced. When George 
returns to London he spends most of his time with the fascinating Mrs. Bellew. 
Unexpected complications arise from the love affair. Mr. Gregory Vigil, Mrs. 
Bellew's guardian and fond admirer, pitying her for her uncomfortable position in 
society, and knowing nothing of her affair with George, decides that she must secure a 
divorce from Captain Bellew. Vigil is much discouraged to hear from a lawyer that
until Captain Bellew gives his wife cause, there can be no divorce. Finally he decides to hire detectives and waits news of Captain Bellew's misdemeanors. Rumor 
of the intended suit reaches Captain Bellew. Knowing his wife's close acquaintance 
with young Pendyce, he writes to George's father, Squire Pendyce, that unless his son 
George breaks with Mrs. Bellew, he will be named as corespondent in the divorce 
suit, Bellew vs. Bellew and Pendyce. George absolutely refuses to give up Mrs. 
Bellew. The Squire is so angry that he revises his will, leaving George only the estate. 
While her husband the Squire is working off his feelings in bluster, quiet Mrs. Pendyce suffers keenly because of her son's entanglement. Unable to stay away from 
her boy, she defies the Squire and goes up to London to comfort George, whom she 
pictures as bowled to the earth by his parent's anger. To her dismay she finds George 
annoyed at her visit and in deep trouble over racing debts. What troubles him most, 
however, is that Helen Bellew has thrown him over. Mrs. Pendyce stays with George 
through the first desperate stage of disappointed love in which he threatens to kill 
himself and then returns to Worsted Skeynes. With deep humiliation she goes to 
tell Captain Bellew that his wife has tired of her poor boy. Dressed in her best frock 
of dove-gray, she crosses the fields to the Bellew place. Captain Bellew shelters her 
from a thunderstorm, and touched by her distress, agrees to withdraw the divorce 
suit and save George's reputation. Mrs. Pendyce comes home very happy, her 
ambition for George's career kindled afresh, and something like forgiveness in her 
heart for Mrs. Bellew.</summary>

her other works, it is a study of New England character, subtle, delicate, temperate, 
a revelation of an artist's mind as well as of people and things. 

The homely heroine is Mrs. Todd, living at Dunnet Landing, on the eastern sea-coast of Maine, a dispenser to the village-folk of herb medicines made from herbs in 
her little garden. "The sea-breezes blew into the low end- window of the house, 
laden with not only sweet-brier and sweet-mary, but balm and sage and borage and 
mint, wormwood and southernwood. " Mrs. Todd's summer-boarder (Miss Jewett 
herself, no doubt) tells the story of her sojourn in the sweet, wholesome house, of her 
many excursions with her hostess, now to a family reunion, now to visit Mrs. Todd's 
mother on Green Island, now far afield to gather rare herbs. The fisher folk, the 
farm folk, and the village folk are depicted with the author's unique skill, living and 
warm through her sympathetic intuition. The book is fresh and clean with sea-air 
and the scent of herbs. Its charm is that of nature itself.</summary>

Balzac's series of 'Scenes from Parisian Life.' In it he intended to portray "a poor 
and simple-minded man, an old man, crushed by humiliations and insults, forgiving 
all and revenging himself only by benefits." The hero is Sylvain Pons, a simple-hearted old musician who has seen his best days professionally, whom his purse-proud 
cousins the Marvilles, wearying of his visits, slight and insult. The vicissitudes of 
the poor fellow make the story. Greed and cunning, in all grades of society, receive 
their due celebration. The Marvilles, the titled Popinots, the theatre director Gaudissard, the various lawyers, the Jewish picture dealers, down to the very lodging-house 
keepers, all are leagued against the one simple-hearted man and triumph at last. 
It is interesting to know that Cousin Pons's great collection, as described in the story, 
was actually Balzac's own, which M. Champfleury visited in 1848, and which, although seen for the first time, seemed strangely familiar to him until "the truth 
flashed upon me. I was in the gallery of Cousin Pons. Here were Cousin Pons's 
pictures, Cousin Pons's curios. I knew them now." The American translation is

Bergson, published in 1907 and in an English translation by Arthur Mitchell in 1911. 
Rejecting monism both idealistic and materialistic, the writer conceives of the universe as neither all spirit nor all matter but as an eternal process, a becoming, which 
preserves the past and creates the future. The world is not fixed but eternally moving, creating, evolving. Time as we ordinarily conceive it is a mere figment of our 
minds, borrowed from the idea of juxtaposition in space. Actual time is eternally 
present time. This conception solves the antinomies of instinct and intelligence, 
matter and spirit, freedom and determinism. Instead of being bound in iron fetters 
of necessity, the universe is ever moving forward, ever evolving in free, creative 
activity. A full summary and criticism of these views will be found in the introductory essay to the extracts from Bergson in the LIBRARY. Bergson 's admirable expository gifts, his success as a lecturer not only in France but in England and in America, 
and the agreement of his philosophy with strong tendencies in modern thought both 
practical and metaphysical, as expressed for example by William James, have won his 
philosophy an extraordinary popularity. </summary>

the murder of an old woman, a money-lender, and her sister, by a student in St. 
Petersburg, Raskolnikoff. The circumstances leading to the murder are extreme 
poverty, and the resultant physical and mental depletion. Raskolnikoff is by nature 
generous, warm-hearted, and high-spirited; but when his body is weakened and his 
~nind depressed, the morbid desire takes possession of him to kill the greasy and repellent old woman, whose wealth seems as lawfully his as hers. From this desire he 
cannot escape. It terrifies yet fascinates him. His state of mind in this crisis is depicted with admirable skill. The murder accomplished, he gains nothing by it: 
in the sudden awful confusion of mind that immediately follows the committal of the 
deed, he can form no definite idea of robbery, and escapes with no booty but the 
memory of one terrific scene which throws him into a delirious fever. At this juncture his mother and sister come to the city. His excited state is perceptible, but they 
can make nothing of it. By a singular chain of incidents he makes the acquaintance 
of a girl, Sonia, who has been driven to an evil life that she may save her family from 
starvation. Believing that her nature is intrinsically noble, Raskolnikoff compels her 
to read aloud to him the story of the raising of Lazarus. This she does in a manner 
which confirms his belief in her. His regeneration then begins. As he was impelled 
to murder, he is now impelled to confess the murder. His sentence is seven years' 
exile to Siberia; but he accepts it with joy, for at its expiration he will begin with 
Sonia, the woman he loves, a life of purity and nobility. They will progress together,

  <summary author="Kant, Immanuel (1724-1804)" title="The Critique of Pure Reason" print_title="The Critique\nof Pure Reason">CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, a philosophical treatise by Immanuel Kant, published in 1781, revised edition in 1787; with the 'Critique of Practical Reason' (1788) 
and the 'Critique of Judgment' (1790) it constitutes a complete statement of Kant's 
transcendental philosophy. This philosophy consists in the critical examination of 
the activities of human reason, which, it finds, transcend the materials furnished by 
sensation. The 'Critique of Pure Reason' is devoted to an analysis of knowledge or 
thought. The judgments of which knowledge consists are the result of intuition and 
understanding. Intuitions present us with perceptions of objects in space and time,
these ideas of space and time are not realities but modes of perceiving objects, they 
are instinctive habits of our minds. Hence our intuitions give us not things in themselves but the appearances of things, "phenomena." Understanding is subdivided 
into Verstand, the faculty of connecting our intuitions to form judgments, and Vernunft, the combination of these judgments into universal ideas. The study of the 
first is called by Kant Transcendental Analytic, that of the second Transcendental 
Dialectic. In the former he reduces the categories or modes of judgment to four 
quantity, quality, relation, and modality, from which he deduces the laws of continuity and of causality. All these categories and principles, he says, are inherent in 
the mind itself and not derived from the external world. The connecting link between 
them and the phenomena conveyed by our intuition is the idea of time which interprets between the intuitions and the judgment. Thus our judgments of the external 
world are the products of our own mind and reveal to us phenomena not noumena or 
realities. Transcendental Dialectic is the analysis of those general ideas, such as the 
thing-in-itself, the absolute, the universe, the soul, and God, which result from the 
combination of our various concepts, judgments, and scientific propositions. These 
ideas, however, like space and time, and the categories, are not realities but the 
methods in which our minds operate. In other words, all knowledge is relative and 
limited by our minds. This leads to absolute scepticism as to the reality corresponding to these general ideas. It leads also to the demonstration of the antinomies or 
theories which, though contradicting one another, are equally capable of proof. It 
may be proved or disproved with equal cogency that the universe is limited or infinite, 
that matter is composed of atoms or infinitely divisible, that free will is possible or 
impossible, and that there is and is not a great first cause. We know only phenomena 
and the corresponding realities are unattainable by our minds, which are limited by 
their own modes of thinking. But in the 'Critique of Practical Reason,' in which he 
turns from knowledge to volition, Kant maintains that the sense of obligation, with 
its direct appeal to the will, brings a certitude in regard to the ultimate realities of the 
universe which pure reason cannot give. The reality of God, of free will, and of 
individual immortality are postulates of the practical reason, i. e. convictions incapable of logical proof but deriving their certainty from their appeal to the will. 
The fact that they cannot be proved but must be accepted by an act of will strengthens their appeal. Finally, in the 'Critique of Judgment,' Kant passes from the 
realms of knowledge and of will to that of feeling, and considers the origin of the 
aesthetic and the teleological senses. These also he finds to be modes of operation 
of the human mind. The beautiful is that which pleases universally by a sense of 
harmony between the understanding and the imagination; the sublime is that which 
disturbs us by a sense of conflict between our imagination and our inability to understand infinity. The teleological sense is the feeling that certain things in nature are 
a result of adaptation. This feeling, an illusion to pure reason, is due to our conception of time, which considers as successive phenomena which are really co-existent. 
The three Critiques form the most important and influential work of modern 
philosophy. They demolished the old dogmatic spiritualism and the old dogmatic 
materialism and set up foundations for a new idealism. Their conceptions have 
contributed to the development of all subsequent systems. 

'The Critique of Pure Reason' was translated into English by John P. Mahaffy 
and John H. Bernard, and also by F. Max Muller. 'The Critique of Practical Reason' was translated by T. K. Abbott; 'The Critique of Judgment' was translated by

becomes a refuge for the persecuted abolitionists of the neighborhood, a basis of operations for the Union sympathizers, and finally the seat of war in the region. The 
novel, though written with a strong ethical purpose, is interesting and effective simply 
as a story, containing much incident and some capital character-studies.</summary>

ranging in subject from the Method of Folk-lore and Star Myths to the Art of Savages, illustrates the author's conception of the inadequacy of the generally accepted 
methods of comparative mythology. He does not believe that "myths are the result 
of a disease of language, as the pearl is the result of a disease of the oyster." The 
notion that proper names in the old myths hold the key to their explanation, as Max 
Muller, Kuhn, Bre*al, and many other eminent philologists maintain, Mr. Lang 
denies; declaring that the analysis of names, on which the whole edifice of philological 
"comparative mythology" rests, is a foundation of sifting sand. Stories are usually 
anonymous at first, he believes, names being added later, and adventures naturally 
grouping themselves around any famous personage, divine, heroic, or human. Thus 
what is called a Greek myth or a Hindu legend may be found current among a people 
who never heard of Greece or India. The story of Jason, for example, is told in Samoa, 
Finland, North America, Madagascar. Each of the myths presented here is made to 
serve a controversial purpose in so far as it supports the essayist's theory that explanations of comparative mythology do not explain. He believes that folk-lore 
contains the survivals of primitive ideas common to many peoples, as similar physical 
and social conditions tend to breed the same ideas. The hypothesis of a myth common to several races rests on the assumption of a common intellectual condition 
among them. We may push back a god from Greece to Phoenicia, from Phoenicia; 
to Accadia, but at the end of the end, we reach a legend full of myths like those which 
Bushmen tell by the camp fire, Eskimo in their dark huts, and Australians in the shade 
of the "gunweh," myths cruel, puerile, obscure, like the fancies of the savage 
myth-makers from which they sprang. The book shows on every page the wide 
reading, the brilliant faculty of generalization, and the delightful popularity and the 
unfailing entertainingness of this literary "Universal Provider," who modestly says 
that these essays are "only flint-like flakes from a neolithic workshop."</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Cymbeline" print_title="Cymbeline">CYMBELINE was written by Shakespeare late in his life, probably about 1609. 
A few facts about Cymbeline and his sons he took from Holinshed; but the story of 
Imogen forms the ninth novel of the second day of Boccaccio's 'Decameron.' These 
two stories Shakespeare has interwoven; and the atmosphere of the two is not dissimilar: there is a tonic moral quality in Imogen's unassailable virtue like the bracing 
mountain air in which the royal youths have been brought up. The beautiful song 
'Fear No More the Heat o' the Sun' was a great favorite with Tennyson. Cymbeline 
wanted his daughter Imogen to marry his stepson Cloten, a boorish lout and cruel 
villain, but she has secretly married a brave and loyal private gentleman, Posthumus 
Leonatus, and he is banished for it. In Italy one Iachimo wagers him ten thousand 
ducats to his diamond ring that he can seduce the honor of Imogen. He miserably 
fails, even by the aid of lies as to the disloyalty of Posthumus, and then pretends he 
was but testing her virtue for her husband's sake. She pardons him, and receives 
into her chamber, for safe-keeping, a trunk, supposed to contain costly plate and 
jewels, but which really contains Iachimo himself, who emerges from it in the dead of 
night; slips the bracelet from her arm; observes the mole, cinque-spotted with crimson 
on her breast; and notes down in his book the furniture and ornaments of the room. 
He returns to Italy. Posthumus despairingly yields himself beaten, and writes to his 
servant Pisanio to kill Imogen; to facilitate the deed, he sends her word to meet him 
at Milford Haven. Thither she flies with Pisanio, who discloses all, gets her to disguise herself in men's clothes and seek to enter the service of Lucius, the Roman 
ambassador. She loses her way, and arrives at the mountain cave in Wales where 
dwell, unknown to her, her two brothers, Guiderius and Arviragus, stolen in infancy.

  <summary author="Rostand, Edmond (1868-1918)" title="Cyrano de Bergerac" print_title="Cyrano de Bergerac">CYRANO DE BERGERAC, by Edmond Rostand (1897). Cyrano de Bergerac, the 
hero of this popular romantic drama, was a poet, prince among wits, brave soldier 
and duellist of the time of Louis XIII. and Richelieu. The play opens in 1640 at a 
Parisian playhouse, where a perf ormarice is about to be given by a troupe of the King's 
players. Cyrano has forbidden one of the actors to appear. He drives him from the 
stage, and entertains the audience, including his cousin, Roxanne, whom he adores, 
by fighting a duel with a titled young fop who resents the interruption of the play and 
provokes a quarrel by mocking Cyrano's immense nose, which none may mention 
with impunity. Cyrano fights the duel with his pointed wit as well as his sword, 
improvising a brilliant ballade on his nose and marking each thrust at his opponent 
with a verse. This scene is quoted in the LIBRARY. Cyrano despairs of winning 
Roxanne because of his grotesque ugliness, but hopes she may love him for his valor 
when she seeks an interview with him after the duel. In his exuberance, he single-handed puts to flight a hundred men, who are waiting in ambush to attack his friend, 
The meeting of Cyrano and Roxanne is at the shop of the poetical pastry cook, who 
sells tarts for sonnets, and is finally reduced to the horrid necessity of wrapping up 
patties in a poem to Phyllis.

Roxanne confesses that she loves one who loves her from afar, but it turns out to be 
not Cyrano but Christian, a stupid handsome youth about to become a member of 
Cyrano's company, the Gascon Cadets. Cyrano hides his heartbreak, promises his 
protection to Christian, and from that moment sacrifices himself to the lovers. 

The ugly Cyrano teaches gallantry to the dull Christian, writes the impassioned 
poetic letters which win his lady-love, and even impersonates him in the darkness, 
wliile Roxanne leans from her balcony. 

The Gascons go to the war, and Christian is killed. Roxanne retires to a convent 
where for fifteen years the faithful Cyrano pays her a weekly visit. As he is leaving 
his house some enemy lets fall a large piece of wood, which strikes his head and wounds 
him mortally. He goes on to the convent and in this last scene of his death, Roxanne, 
who had loved her hero first for his beauty and then for his soul, as shown in his letters, 
discovers the secret of the double wooing and laments, "I loved but once, yet twice I 
lose my love."</summary>
  <summary author="James, Henry (1843-1916)" title="Daisy Miller: A Study" print_title="Daisy Miller:\nA Study">DAISY MILLER, by Henry James, a novelette published in 1878, is one of his most 
famous stories. Its heroine is a young girl from Schenectady, "admirably pretty," 
who is traveling about Europe with her placid mother, and her dreadful little brother 
Randolph. Mrs. Miller never thinks of interfering with her children, and allows her 
daughter to go for moonlight drives with young men, and her son of ten to sit up eating 
candies in hotel parlors till one o'clock, with an occasional qualm, indeed, but with 
no consciousness of countenancing a social lapse, her code of etiquette being that of a 
rural American town, with no authoritv of long descent. From the constant incongruity between the Miller social standards and the Draconian code of behavior of the 
older European communities, come both the motive and the plot of the story, which 
is one of the most skillful and convincing of the very clever artist who wrote it. Upon 
its publication, however, American society at home and abroad was mightily indignant over what it pronounced Mr. James's base libel on the American young girl, and 
American social training. But when it came to be read more soberly, the reader 
perceived that the subtle painter of manners had really delineated a charming type 
of innocence and self-respect, a type so confident of its own rectitude as to be careless 
of external standards. It was seen to be the environment only that distorted and 
misrepresented this type, and that in the more primitive civilization which produced 
it, it would have been without flaw. In a word, the thoughtful reader discovered that 
Mr. James's sketch, so far as it had a bias at all, was a plea for justice to a new manifestation of character, the product of new conditions, that can never hope to be understood when measured by standards wholly outside its experience. The book is one 
of the most brilliant, as it is one of the most subtle and artistic, of this author's productions.</summary>

The story follows the life of Paul Meyerhofer, a boy at whose cradle Care seemed to 
preside. He was born on the day his father's estate was sold at auction. His childhood was spent in poverty, his boyhood and youth in hard work. He had always 
before him the spectacle of a cowed, suffering mother; of an overbearing, shiftless 
father, whose schemes for making money only plunged his family in deeper misfortune. His younger sisters, when they grow up, bring disgrace upon him. To save 
their honor he makes enormous sacrifices; in short, his whole career is one of misfortune. The one brightness of his life is his love for Elsbeth Douglas, the daughter of 
his godmother. At the close of the novel it is intimated that he will marry her, and 
that "Dame Care," his foster-mother, will not trouble him again. The story, written 
with much pathos and beauty, is a peculiar blending of realism and romanticism.</summary>

  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="Daniel Deronda" print_title="Daniel Deronda">DANIEL DERONDA (1876), George Eliot's last novel, considered by some critics 
her greatest work, has repelled others by its careful analysis of Jewish character. It 
really has two separate parts, and two chief figures, each very unlike the other. 
Gwendolen Harleth, the heroine, and Daniel Deronda, the hero, first see each other at 
Baden, where Gwendolen tries her luck at the gaming-table. When they next meet, 
Gwendolen is the fiancee of Henleigh Grandcourt, nephew of young Deronda's 
guardian, Sir Hugh Mallinger. Grandcourt is a finished type of the selfish man of 
the world. He marries the beautiful, penniless Gwendolen, less for love than in a 
fit of obstinacy, as his confidant Mr. Lush puts it. - Gwendolen, as selfish as he, consents to marry him because only thus can she save her mother, her stepsisters, and 
herself, from the poverty which the sudden loss of their property is likely to bring 
them. The tragedy of her married life is told with dramatic force and profound 
insight. Deronda has been brought up by Sir Hugh in ignorance of his parentage. 
His fine education and great talents he is always ready to place at the service of 
others. By befriending a Jewish girl, Mirah Lapidoth, he comes in close contact with 
several Jewish families, grows deeply interested in Jewish history and religion, and 
when the secret of his birth is revealed to him is glad to cast in his lot with theirs. 
The influence of Deronda on Gwendolen is very marked, and the story closes with the 
prophecy of a lessening selfishness and egotism on her part. Gwendolen's mother, 
Mrs. Davilow; her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, and their children; the 
wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Arrowsmith, whose daughter has the courage to marry the 
man she loves, a poor music teacher, one Herr Klesmer, are the chief minor characters. Other people appear, like Lord Brackenshaw and Mrs. Gadsby; but less care 
is given to the portrayal of these than to the noble Mordecai, the garrulous Cohens, 
and the other Jewish types, or even to Deronda's friend Mrs. Merrick, and her artist 
son Hans. 

In 'Daniel Deronda' George Eliot had three objects in view: 1. To show the influence of heredity; 2. To show that ideals and sentiments Heat the basis of religion; 
3. To contrast a social life founded on tradition (that of the Jews) with mere individualism. As a plea for the Jews this book not only met the approval of the thoughtful 
men of that race, but also gave the world in general a just idea of this complex people.</summary>
  <summary author="Galsworthy, John (1867-1933)" title="The Dark Flower" print_title="The Dark Flower">DARK FLOWER, THE, by John Galsworthy (1913), is the story of one man's love-affairs. We first see the hero, Mark Lennan, when he is a student at Oxford. During 
the Easter holidays, he goes to the Tyrol with his tutor, Harold Stormer. There he 
falls in love with Stormer's Austrian wife, Anna. When Mark is called home suddenly to attend the wedding of his sister in Derbyshire, he makes Anna promise that 
she and her husband will come to visit him before the Oxford term begins. When he 
goes, Anna gives him a clove pink, the "dark flower" of passion which gives the book 
its title. The Stormers come down to Derbyshire. Anna notices something of which 
Mark himself is as yet unaware that he loves Sylvia, the pretty cousin who had been 
his sister's bridesmaid. Unable to remain and see the romance blossom, Anna hurries her husband back to Oxford. Mark's guardian has guessed Anna's secret, and 
arranges for Mark to go to Italy instead of to Oxford to study. Thus Mark's first 
flame passes out of his life. When the reader meets him eight years later Mark is in 
Rome. He is already a sculptor to be reckoned with. He is in love with Olive 
Cramier, a beautiful poetic creature yoked to an adoring but materialistic husband. 
When she returns to England, Mark follows. Cramier feels that his wife sees too 
much of the young sculptor and sends her to the country, to a pretty cottage on the 
river. There Olive struggles in vain against her passion. Finally she telegraphs 
Mark to come down, feigns a headache to deceive her kindly old aunt and uncle, meets 
Mark at the bank, and goes away with him in a canoe. When they return, hours 
after, they have formulated plans for an elopement. As they are getting out of the 
canoe, Olive's husband, who had come down from London to watch his wife, comes 
from behind a bush. He pushes the woman into the deep water, and though Mark 
struggles to save her, she is drowned. The truth about Olive's death is never known; 
there is report of "an accident." When we meet Lennan again, he is forty-six, 
married to the charming Sylvia, childless, and embarked upon another passion. 
This time he falls in love with a young girl, Nell Dromore, the natural daughter of an 
Oxford classmate. Unschooled in control, Nell finds it impossible to hide her passion 
from Mark. Unable to repulse a young girl who is devoted to him, although at first 
he has no more than a fatherly affection for her, Mark makes flimsy excuses to Sylvia, 
and visits the Dromores frequently. When he once realizes the true state of his feelings, Lennan confesses to his wife, secures her forgiveness, and goes with her to Italy, 
leaving Nell behind with her father and the adoring young cousin whom one assumes 
she will finally marry.</summary>
  <summary author="Walpole, Hugh, Sir (1884-1941)" title="The Dark Forest" print_title="The Dark Forest">DARK FOREST, THE, by Hugh Walpole (1916). The story opens with the departure of a Red Cross unit from Petrograd. All are Russians except two Englishmen, 
Durward, of analytic temperament, who tells the story, and Trenchard, timid, blunderng, inefficient, who is the chief character. Trenchard is seeking the sympathy and 
affection he has not found at home. Sister Marie, a young Russian girl, eager for 
life, becomes engaged to Trenchard in the excitement and exaltation of the last days 
of preparation. On the journey Trenchard is the butt of the party and especially 
of the efficient dominating male, Dr. Semyonov, who finally wins Marie from him. 
The narrative is the struggle of these two men for complete possession of Marie, since 
she has given something different of herself to each lover. She is killed by an Austrian bullet in the Dark Forest, but the duel between the two men continues, as each 
believes that the one who meets death first will find her. The war is the background 
and atmosphere for the story. The Forest is present as vividly as the War, perhaps 
typifying the War. It is uncanny with its thick bright foliage which seems to give no 
shade. The Dark Forest covers dead Austrians, villages of starving old people, 
cholera villages, trenches, and Red Cross shelters, where "the wounded were brought 
in without pause." Again the Forest, always green and glittering, is lovely in an 
early summer morning with the singing of birds. At night "the Forest was deep 
black, " the soldiers' hres gleaming here and there like beasts' eyes." The stress and 
strain of the Red Cross service is continuous. Trenchard goes out with wagons to 
the "screaming Forest" and is "overwhelmed by the blind indifference of the place, 
listening still to the incredible birds." He is exhausted with "endless bandaging, 
cleaning of filthy wounds, paring away the ragged ends of flesh, smelling, breathing, 
drinking blood and dust and dirt." Death, which is as close as life, has a glamor and 
fascination. Trenchard and Dr. Semyonov covet death, because of their obsession of 
its reward of union with Marie. In his last diary, death to Trenchard has ceased to 
be the terror of his childhood; he had laughed at death under fire; he had cursed it 
when Marie died; face to face with it, he feels "one is simply face to face with one's 
self." A shell breaks overhead, and of the four it is Trenchard who is killed and the 
stronger character, Semyonov the realist, who is left.</summary>
  <summary author="Chekhov, Anton Pavlovich (1860-1904)" title="The Darling and Other Stories" print_title="The Darling\nand\nOther Stories">DARLING AND OTHER STORIES, THE, by Anton Chekhov (1916). These short 
stories describe a variety of types of women. The title story, ' The Darling ' is a 
study of a woman, who lives only in her affections, and takes her opinions from others. 
Olinka is equally devoted to two husbands and a lover in succession. Losing her 
lover, she adopts his son, a schoolboy, whose world she lives in, perfectly satisfied. 
The transference of her affections is as automatic as the reflection of a chamelion to its 
surroundings. 'Ariadne' is a type of parasite, caring for nothing but attention and 
luxury. She travels about Europe with one lover until his money is exhausted, then 
calls another to her, and leaves him to marry a wealthy old prince. ' The Helpmate' 
is also an ironical study of sex. In ' The Two Volodyas' the neurotic Sofya thinks 
she is in love with her elderly husband one day, and abandons herself to the other 
'Volodya,' his young friend, the next. Still another type ie Polinka, a deluded little 
dressmaker who loses her head over a student, and is bewitched away from the 
young salesman who loves her. 'Three Years' begins with the passionate love of 
Laptev for the indifferent Yulia. After three years she comes to love him, and his 
only feeling is that he is hungry for his lunch. ' The Princess ' is another satire on a 
woman who believes herself an angel beloved by everyone, but is shown to be a selfish 
egotist justly hated by those for whom she poses as benefactress. An exquisite old 
mother in 'The Trousseau,' spends her life making a wonderful trousseau for a 
daughter who never marries, and dies when they are two old women together. This
story is reprinted in the LIBRARY. Destiny plays with the happiness of all these people 
as a cat with mice, and they accept life, Russian fashion, as a thing to be patiently 
endured.</summary>

pupil at Holmsworth Preparatory School, is with the other boys writing letters home 
on a Sunday afternoon. Mr. Button is the master in charge of this arduous task, 
to which twenty minutes is the time allotted. The Head of the School, Mr. Anscam, 
a man of rare qualities, who inspires his pupils with both terror and admiration, 
suddenly appears and detects Dutton reading under cover of his Bible and Prayer-book a yellow-covered volume of stories by de Maupassant. The Head tears the 
book apart, and excuses his assistant from the lessons to follow, taking charge himself, 
and finding a sad lack of knowledge on the part of the pupils. David is a genuine 
boy, full of spirit, love of mischief and of sport, with a lovable disposition which 
makes him a favorite with the best of his schoolmates. Everything that is beautiful, 
especially in poetry, attracts him, and he is so impressed by the Headmaster's 
reading of Keats that he longs to possess a volume of his poems. The great event 
of the year is the cricket-match with Eagles school. Although David belongs to the 
eleven he feels "beastly" on the day of the match because his father, an archdeacon, 
comes to see the game. The boys make fun of the archdeacon's peculiarities in 
dress and manner, and this causes the son to feel so uncomfortable that he fails to do 
himself justice and loses the match, although he does some fine playing later in the 
day, after his staunch friend Bags has lured his father out of the way. The following 
week David goes to Marchester to take his examinations for a scholarship, and there 
he meets Frank Maddox, a fellow three years his senior, who becomes a great hero 
in his eyes. David's last days at Holmsworth pass in triumph, for although he loses 
the scholarship he wins the final cricket-match for the school. During the vacation 
at Baxminster, where his father and sister live, he meets Frank Maddox again and his 
admiration for him increases. When he goes to Marchester in the autumn he becomes Maddox's fag and devoted slave. David still keeps up his interest in cricket 
and distinguishes himself in many matches which are described with great detail. 
When David has reached the sixth form, Maddox is at Cambridge. Just before the 
end of the summer term David is seriously injured in trying to stop a runaway horse. 
His life is despaired of. Maddox, who happens to have come at this juncture, succeeds in soothing his restlessness, so that he falls into a long sleep at the critical 
moment and his life is saved.</summary>
  <summary author="Dickens, Charles (1812-1870)" title="David Copperfield" print_title="David Copperfield">DAVID COPPERFIELD. "Of all my books," says Charles Dickens in his preface 
to this immortal novel, "I like this the best. . . . Like many fond parents, I have 
in my heart of hearts a favorite child. And his name is David Copperfield." When 
'David Copperfield 1 appeared in 1850, after 'Dombey and Son' and before 
'Bleak House/ it became so popular that its only rival was 'Pickwick.' Beneath 
the fiction lies much of the author's personal life, yet it is not an autobiography. 
The story treats of David's sad experiences as a child, his youth at school, 
and his struggles for a livelihood, and leaves him in early manhood, prosperous and 
happily married. Pathos, humor, and skill in delineation give vitality to this 
work; and nowhere has Dickens filled his canvas with more vivid and 
diversified characters. Forster says that the author's favorites were the Peggotty 
family, composed of David's nurse Peggotty, who was married to Barkis, the carrier; 
Dan'el Peggotty, her brother, a Yarmouth fisherman; Ham Peggotty, his nephew; 
the doleful Mrs. Gummidge; and Little Em'ly, ruined by David's schoolmate, 
Steerforth. "It has been their fate," says Forster, "as with all the leading figures of 
his invention, to pass their names into the language and become types; and he has 
nowhere given happier embodiment to that purity of homely goodness, which, by the 
kindly and all-reconciling influences of humor, may exalt into comeliness and even 
grandeur the clumsiest forms of humanity." 

Miss Betsy Trotwood, David's aunt; the half-mad but mild Mr. Dick; Mrs. 
Copper-field, David's mother; Murdstone, his brutal stepfather; Miss Murdstone, 
that stepfather's sister; Mr. Spenlow and his daughter Dora, David's "child-wife"; Steerforth, Rosa Dartle, Mrs. Steerforth, Mr. Wickfield, his daughter 
Agnes (David's second wife), and the Micawber family, are the persons around whom 
the interest revolves. A host of minor characters, such as the comical little dwarf 
hair-dresser, Miss Mowcher, Mr. Mell, Mr. Creakle, Tommy Traddles, Uriah Heep, 
Dr. Strong, Mrs. Marldeham, and others, are portrayed with the same vivid strokes.</summary>

Like 'Robert Elsmere,' it takes greatly into account social and educational forces 
of contemporary life. It was written apparently under the influence of 'Amid's 
Journal,' as it embodies the same cheerless and somewhat negative philosophy. 

The hero, David Grieve, and his sister Louie, are the children of Sandy Grieve, 
a Scotch workingman, and of a Frenchwoman, a grisette, of depraved tendencies. 
The girl inherits the mother's nature, the boy the father's. David begins life as a 
country boy in Derbyshire, tending his uncle's sheep. His leisure moments are devoted to reading and study. As a boy of sixteen he leaves the home that had become 
intolerable, and goes to Manchester, where he learns the bookseller's trade and 
educates himself further, becoming finally the head of a publishing-house well known 
for its publications of economic and political works. His life, however, is far from 
happy. His sister goes to the bad in Paris. He marries a woman unworthy of him. 
Throughout, he clings to a high ethical ideal as the only hope, the only faith open to a 
nineteenth century man. Conduct is for him the whole of life. On right-doing his 
soul rests and depends, in the stress of the tempest of passion and sin about him. 

The novel is well written, abounding in striking and dramatic scenes, and rich in 
delineation of character.</summary>
  <summary author="Gogol, Nikolai Vasilevich (1809-1852)" title="Dead Souls" print_title="Dead Souls">DEAD SOULS, by N. V. Gogol (1846). This panorama of Russian national life is 
the greatest humorous novel in the Russian language. In the days of serfdom, "serfs" 
were referred to as "souls," and the value of a man's estate was reckoned by the 
number of "souls" he owned. The government, to induce colonization in southern 
Russia, offered tracts of land to anyone who would go there with enough serfs to till 
the soil. The hero, Chichikov, conceives the plan of buying up on paper serfs who 
have died since the last decennial census and are therefore officially alive in the 
records. With his hundreds of "dead souls" he will obtain the land, and then raise 
money by mortgaging serfs and land. While engaged in the acquisition of this 
strange property, he travels through Russia, and has many ludicrous adventures. 
In one community it is rumored that he is Napoleon, escaped from St. Helena
traveling in disguise. The reader is introduced to every kind of Russian of every 
grade of society, officials, landed proprietors, Russians drunk and sober. The general 
ignorance, dullness, and stupidity of the small town society is reflected in a comic 
mirror. At last he comes to grief through a scheme to forge a will. His former 
history of smuggling goods through the custom house, and his present transactions 
in dead souls are brought to light in the examination before the judge, and he is 
thrown into prison, just as he had acquired an estate, and repenting his crooked ways 
is about to turn his energies to living a respectable life. He escapes by spiriting away 
the witnesses, bribing the officials and involving prominent people in his scandalous 
affairs. He starts on his travels again, this time to find a wife and settle down, and 
after some misadventures he succeeds in his quest. After ten years of the life of a 
model country gentleman he is elected marshall for his district, in spite of rumors 
that he had once speculated in corpses to utilize their bones for commerce. He lives 
to a green old age with his wife and nine children, generally esteemed and respected.

  <summary author="Freytag, Gustav (1816-1895)" title="Debit and Credit" print_title="Debit and Credit">DEBIT AND CREDIT ('Soil und Haben'), by Gustav Freytag (1855)* In this story 
are portrayed with rare keenness and fidelity the characteristics of German nationaility in its various classes. The honorable independence, patriotism, commercial 
sagacity, and cultured commonsense of the middle industrial class, which forms the 
solid substratum of society, are well contrasted with the impassible exclusiveness and 
pecuniary irresponsibility of the nobility on the one hand, and the stolid ignorance 
of the peasant ry and the scheming of the Jews on the other. Written in the troublous 
times after '48, its avowed purpose was to arouse the German youth to a sense of their 
opportunities and responsibilities, a purpose in which it succeeded. Its truthfulness to life, its delightful diction and variety of incident, assured its immediate 
popularity; and to-day it is regarded as the best German novel of the age. Most of 
the action is influenced by counting-house ethics; and it is emphatically the story of 
the old commercial house of Schroter. Yet with what an inferior artist would have 
found prosaic material, Freytag produces an intensely dramatic tale, its realism 
transfused and illuminated by a glowing imagination. The plot is intricate and 
exciting, but the value of the story lies in its strong studies of character, and the sense 
it conveys of inevitability, in its logical deduction of event from cause. An excellent 
English translation was published in 1874. </summary>

pestilence of 1348 seven ladies and three gentlemen of Florence take refuge in the 
country, traveling from one country-house to another and passing the time in games, 
reading, conversation, love-making, and the telling of stories. One of the number is 
appointed king or queen for each day, and under his or her direction each member of 
the company contributes one narrative each day, for ten days; after which they 
return to their homes. The various stories are adapted to their narrators, and are 
told in a natural sequence, one suggesting another; moreover the descriptions of the 
surroundings and occupations of the company and of the by-play between them make 
an effective and dramatic background. The stories taken as a whole cover almost 
every phase of human life, the pathetic, the humorous, the base, and the noble. 
Many are satirical tales of clerical misconduct or of feminine guile; others are humorous but indecent anecdotes of the French fabliau type. These classes spring from 
the revolt against asceticism. Other groups are elaborated from popular tales or 
romances like the story of Gilletta of Narbonne, the source of Shakespeare's 'All's 
Well that Ends Well.' Among the tragic love stories are those of Tancred and 
Ghismonda and Isabella and the Pot of Basil. Famous tales of an 'idealistic and 
moral character are the Jew's story of the three rings, used by Lessing in ' Nathan 
der Weise'; the story of the Knight and the Falcon, retold by Tennyson and Longfellow; and an analogue of Chaucer's ' Franklin's Tale' of the rash promise; and the 
original of his story of Griselda. Boccaccio was supremely interested in humanity, 
was a consummate narrator, and, though overfond of involved classical periods, is 
the father of modern Italian prose style.</summary>

setting forth the righteousness of just retribution. The author calls it the story 
of the Prodigal Son. The scene is laid in the Isle of Man, in the latter part of the 
seventeenth century and the early part of the eighteenth. 

The Deemster is Thorkell Mylrea, whose brother Gilchrist is bishop of the island. 
These two brothers, with Ewan and Mona, the son and daughter of the Deemster, 
and Daniel, the son of the Bishop, are the chief actors in the story. Ewan is a young 
clergyman, but Dan is the prodigal who wastes his father's substance. He loves his 
cousin Mona deeply, but her brother considers this love dishonorable to her. The 
cousins engage in a duel, which results in the death of Ewan. Dan surrenders himself 
to justice, is declared guilty, and receives a sentence worse than death. He is declared 
cut off forever from Hs people. None shall speak to him or look upon him or give 
him aid. He shall live and die among the beasts in a remote corner of the island. 

At length a strange plague comes upon the people. Daniel obtains the privilege 
of taking the place of Father Dalby, the Irish priest. He effects many cures, and at 
last dies of the pestilence, after the office of deemster made vacant by his uncle's 
death has been offered to him as a reward for his services. Like all of Hall Caine's 
work, it is sombre and oppressive, but its delineation of Manx character is striking 
and convincing. A dramatization has been produced by Wilson Barrett under

represent the gentlefolk of the town, and visionary Captain Sands, Isaac Horn, and 
hind-hearted Danny, the seafaring ones, not without JacofrLunt "condemned as 
unsea worthy." Old Mrs. Bonny lives in the woods beyond the town; and Miss 
Chauncey, a pathetic old lady who has lost her mind, live? alone in the village of 
East Parish. When the leaves have fallen and the sea looks rough and cold, the two 
heroines close the old house and return to their homes in the city, the inevitable 
end. This was one of the first books on New England life Miss Jewett wrote; and 
it was published in 1877, when she was only twenty years old. The book has done 
for the region it describes something of what Irving 's writing did for the Hudson 
River. </summary>

own words, of Matthew Blacklock, a hero of finance and a self-made man. He is 
endowed with brains, a powerful will, and striking personality and has worked his 
way from the foot of the ladder until he has become a conspicuous figure in Wall 
Street. While still young, he has amassed a fortune and has surrounded himself 
with all the luxuries of life, but is not admitted to the inner circles of society where he 
aspires to be. Blacklock, or Black Matt as he is familiarly called has men friends 
belonging to this exclusive class who have not scrupled to accept his business "tips" 
but who never entertain him socially. This is a source of great dissatisfaction to Matt 
who does not realize his lack of social training and feels his success in life has made 
him eligible for any company. He meets Anita Ellersly, the sister of one of his 
aristocratic friends, and in spite of her evident repugnance for him makes up his 
mind to win her for his wife. He secures his entree into their family circle by assisting 
Anita's father, who is financially involved, and when he proposes marriage is accepted 
by Anita who tells him she can never care for him as she loves someone else. The 
latter proves to be Mowray Langdon, an old lover of Anita's, who is unhappily 
married and who has had business dealings with Matt. After the engagement is 
made public Langdon does everything in his power to ruin Matt financially and 
almost succeeds. Mr. and Mrs. Ellersly hearing that Matt is ruined cast him off,

has never known the meaning of the word fail, succeeds in gaining Anita's love and

  <summary author="Dewey, John (1859-1952)" title="Democracy and Education" print_title="Democracy and Education">DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION, a sociological and philosophical treatise by 
John Dewey, was published in 1916. It affords the clearest statement of the author's 
psychological, ethical, and educational views, which are here applied to the solution 
of educational problems in the modem democratic state. The book falls into four 
parts. Chapters I. to VII. outline the general nature of education and its function 
in society. Education is defined as "that reconstruction or reorganization of 
experience which adds to the meaning of experience, and which increases ability to 
direct the course of subsequent experience." This result is obtained by a process of 
transmission, partly spontaneous, partly deliberate, of the acquirements of society, 
with the aim of preserving social continuity. Democratic societies are those which 
afford equal opportunity for development and equal social privileges to all their 
members. To be adapted to a democratic society, education must give all individuals 
a personal interest in social relationships, and the power of effecting social changes 
without disorder. It must not trust merely to the force of custom, operating under 
the control of a superior class.

In the second part of the book (Chapters VTII.-XVIL), coming down to particular questions of subject-matter and method, the author shows that education aims 
at natural development, social efficiency, and mental enrichment; that discipline, or 
the presentation of a lesson to be learned as a task, must be united with interest, or 
the realization by the pupil of the relation of this task to his own activities and 
personal concerns; that thinking must be preceded by experience, mental instruction by physical experiment; that the pupil must be encouraged to think for himself 
and to work out his own mental conclusions; and that the subject-matter of education 
must not be mere information, but information which he can apply in some way to 
some situation of his own. Occupational training, in order to be truly educational, 
must require the pupil's judgment and admit the possibility of mistakes. Play is 
distinguished from work in that its aim is continued activity and not a definite 
result. Being a necessity of our nature, it must be provided for in every scheme of 
education. Geography and history enlarge the significance of the pupil's experience 
of nature and man; science broadens his horizon and cultivates the power of generalized thinking. 

The third part (Chapters XVIIL-XXIII.) examines the hindrances to ideal 
democratic education which spring from the notion "that experience consists of a 
variety of segregated domains or interests, each having its own independent value, 
material, and method, each checking every other." This theory, which results 
from the division of society into rigidly-marked classes and groups, issues in certain 
dualisms or antitheses between culture and utility, leisure and labor, intellectual and 
practical studies, social and physical subjects, the individual and society, liberal and 
vocational training. All these contradictions Dewey would remove by rejecting 
the dualism which prompted them. All pupils are to have the opportunity of enjoying both types of training, in preparation for serving the state as a whole. 

In conclusion (Chapters XXIV.-XXVI.) the author states his philosophy of 
education in connection with the theory of knowledge and of conduct. As regards 
knowledge he is a pragmatist, or, as he prefers to call himself, an experimentalist, 
believing that truth is determined by the practical test of experience. In ethics he 
believes that the moral life of the individual is one, not separated into provinces of 
inner and outer, duty and interest, intelligence and character. 

The book abounds in helpful definitions, clear distinctions, and genuine reconciliations of opposite ideas. The expository method is clear, and made even more lucid 
by the summaries appended to each chapter and by the plain, sometimes even 
colloquial diction. A reviewer has called this the most important educational treatise 
since Plato and Rousseau.</summary>
  <summary author="Conway, Moncure Daniel (1832-1907)" title="Demonology and Devil-lore" print_title="Demonology and Devil-lore">DEMONOLOGY AND DEVIL-LORE, by Moncure D. Conway (1879). In this 
scholarly history of a superstition, the author has set before himself the task of finding 
"the reason of unreason, the being and substance of unreality, the law of folly, and 
the logic of lunacy." His business is not alone to record certain dark vagaries of 
human intelligence, but to explain them; to show them as the inevitable expression 
of a mental necessity, and as the index to some spiritual facts with large inclusions. 
He sees that primitive man has always personified his own thoughts in external 
personal forms; and that these personifications survive as traditions long after a more 
educated intelligence surrenders them as facts. He sets himself, therefore, to seek 
in these immature and grotesque imaginings the soul of truth and reality that once 
inspired them. From anthropology, history, tradition, comparative mythology and 
philology; from every quarter of the globe; from periods which trail off into prehistoric time, and from periods almost within our own remembrance; from savage 
and from cultivated races; from extinct peoples and those now existing; from learned 
sources and the traditions of the unlearned, he has sought his material. This vast 
accumulation of facts he has so analyzed and synthesized as to make it yield its fine 
ore of truth concerning spiritual progress. Related beliefs he has grouped either in 
natural or historical association; migrations of beliefs he has followed, with a keen 
sense for their half -obliterated trail; through diversities his trained eye discovers 
likenesses. He finds that devils have always stood for the type of pure malignity; 
while demons are creatures driven by fate to prey upon mankind for the satisfaction 
of their needs, but not of necessity malevolent. The demon is an inference from the 
physical experience of mankind; the devil is a product of his moral consciousness. 
The dragon is a creature midway between the two.</summary>
  <summary author="Darwin, Charles (1809-1882)" title="The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex" print_title="The Descent of Man,\nand Selection\nin Relation to Sex">DESCENT OF MAN AND SELECTION IN RELATION TO SEX, THE, by Charles 
Darwin. The 'Descent of Man' was given to the world in 1871, eleven years after 
the appearance of the 'Origin of Species,' when Darwin was sixty-two years old. In 
spite of the opposition which the theories of the earlier work had met in some quarters, 
it had already given hfop a place as a leader of scientific thought, not only in England 
but in the whole world. "Darwinism" had in fact become a definite term, and the 
new book was received with interest. The evidences of the descent of man from some 
earlier, less-developed form, collected and marshaled by Darwin, consist of minute 
inferential proofs of similarity of structure; at certain stages of development, between 
man and the lower animals. This similarity is especially marked in the embryonic
stages; and taken with the existence in man of various rudimentary organs, seems to 
imply that he and the lower animals come from a common ancestor. From the 
evidences thus collected, Darwin reasons that the early ancestors of man must have 
been more or less monkey-like animals of the great anthropoid group, and related to 
the progenitors of the orang-outang, the chimpanzee, and the gorilla. They must 
have been hairy, with pointed, movable ears, and a movable tail. They probably lived 
in trees, and had a thumb-like great toe, ate fruit chiefly, and made their home in a 
warm forest land. Going back still farther, Darwin shows that the remotest ancestor 
of humanity must have been aquatic. As a partial proof of this, human lungs are 
said to be modified swim-bladders. The general descent is given by Darwin somewhat in this fashion: From the jelly-like larva to the early fishes, such as the lancelet, 
then to the ganoids (as the mudfish), to the newt and other amphibians, then to the 
platypus and other mammals such as the kangaroo, and to the insectivorous animals 
such as the shrews and hedgehogs; after this by well-marked stages to the lemurs of 
Madagascar, and then to the monkeys, which branch into those of the Old and the 
New World, from the latter of which man is descended. Without entering here 
into the question as to whether all the steps were proved, it is enough to say that the 
'Descent of Man' was received with enthusiasm by scientific men, and that its 
immediate influence was even greater than that of the 'Origin of Species.' It had 
an effect not merely on physical and biological science, but it led to many new conceptions in ethics and religion. In the volumes containing the 'Descent of Man' 
Darwin placed his elaborate treatise on 'Sexual Selection,' which indeed may be 
regarded as a part of the theory of man's descent. The theory of a common origin of 
man and the other vertebrates was not new; but he was the first to develop a tenable 
theory as to the process</summary>

(1884. 9th ed. 1886). This argument, originally an address delivered before the 
Concord School of Philosophy, gives the simplest possible statement of the general 
theory not the particular processes of evolution, and openly endeavors to 
reconcile the spirit and teachings of modern science with those of the New Testament. 
While declaring that the brain of an Australian savage is many times further removed 
from Shakespeare's than from an orang-outang's, he yet shows that evolution, far 
from degrading man to the level of the beast, makes it evident that man is the chief 
object of the Divine care. Man is, after all, the center of the universe though 
not in the sense that the oppressors of Bruno and Galileo supposed. And before 
man's reinstatement in his central and dominant position became possible, the limited 
and distorted hypothesis of theologians and poets had to be overthrown. Much 
stress is laid on the insignificance of physical in comparison with psychical phenomena: more amazing than the change from a fin to a fore-limb are the psychical 
variations that set in (almost to the exclusion of physical variations) after the 
beginnings of intelligence in the human species. The superiority of man lies not in 
perfection but in improvableness. The body is becoming a mere vehicle for that 
soul which for a long time was only an appendage to it. On scientific grounds there 
is no argument for immortality and none against it; but if the work of evolution does 
not culminate in immortality, then the universe is indeed reduced to a meaningless 
riddle. </summary>

her light the other men and women live and move, and by her light they are judged. 
She is an Irishwoman of good family. As a girl she makes an unfortunate marriage 
with a Mr. Warwick, who so little knows her true character that he suspects her of 
an intrigue with a Lord Dannisburg, and begins proceedings against her. Diana's 
separation from her husband is the beginning of her picturesque but always honorable 
career, and the true initial point of the story. She is one of the most charming of 
Meredith's women. The famous incident of her betrayal of a political secret, as well 
as some traits of her character, was drawn from Lady Caroline Norton, Sheridan's 
granddaughter, famous for her beauty, her wit, and her independence of conventional 
opinion. It was later proved, however, that Lady Norton did not betray the secret; 
and this act remains to many readers an incomprehensible act on the part of Diana.</summary>

Captain Sarrasin, who has traveled and fought in many countries, and whose wife on 
occasion can don men's garments and handle a gun; Dolores Paulo; and the Duchess 
of Deptford, of American birth, a caricature rather than a true type. The plot

of Keith Rickman, a Cockney poet, and son of a sordid London bookseller, in whose 
soul dwells "the divine fire." Rickman finds his feminine ideal in the aristocratic 
and high-minded Lucia Harden, whose library he has been sent to catalogue. Lucia 
is on the point of becoming betrothed to her cousin Horace Jewdwine, the deterioration of whose character is outlined in contrast to the development of that of Rickman, 
who triumphs over his disadvantages of birth and breeding and over the temptations 
which arise in connection with his business and journalistic life. Jewdwine, the 
priggisn and refined Oxford don, comes to London to edit the Museion, a progressive literary journal, with idealistic aims; through his association with the embryo 
poet the latter becomes acquainted with Lucia Harden; she, while repelled by the 
young poet's crudeness and lack of breeding, nevertheless discerns his genius and is 
gradually more and more strongly drawn towards him. Lucia's cousin, for whom 
she feels no genuine sentiment, finds it to his advantage to defer any immediate 
matrimonial project and in the meantime she learns to love Rickman, who adores 
her at a distance. Many complications spring from the disposition of the Harden 
library, which contains priceless volumes and falls a prey to sharpers. Rickman 
passes through many vicissitudes, social, financial, and literary, and his connection with editors and magazines gives the writer of the book an ample opportunity, which she improves, to discourse upon the varying types of editors and 
reviewers.</summary>

novels, following a year after its predecessor 'Mr. Isaacs.' Unlike the latter, it 
contains no element of the supernatural, and is merely a love story of contemporary 
life. Dr. Claudius, himself, when first introduced, is a privatdocent at Heidelberg, 
living simply, in a state of philosophical content. He plans no change in his life 
when the news comes to him that he has inherited more than a million dollars by the 
death of his uncle Gustavus Lindstrand, who had made a fortune in New York. 
The son of his partner, Silas B. Barker, soon arrives in Heidelberg to see what manner 
of man Dr. Claudius may be, and persuades the blond, stalwart Scandinavian to go 
with him to America; securing an invitation for the two on the private yacht of an 
English duke, whom he knows well. Before leaving Heidelberg, Claudius has fallen 
in love with a beautiful woman met by chance in the ruins of the Schloss. Since she 
is also a friend of the Duke, Barker is able to introduce Claudius to her. This Countess Margaret, with her companion, Miss Skeat, is asked to cross the Atlantic with 
the Duke, his sister Lady Victoria, Barker, and Claudius. Margaret, though an 
American, is the widow of a Russian count. Claudius is not wholly disheartened, 
when, on the yacht, she refuses to marry him. But in America, she succumbs to the 
romantic surroundings of the Cliff Walk at Newport, and admits that she loves the 
philosophical millionaire. Claudius then starts off on a hasty journey to St. Petersburg, where he obtains from the government the return of Margaret's estates confiscated on account of her brother-in-law's republicanism. Just what the secret is of 
Dr. Claudius's power with Russia, we are not told; but Mr. Crawford lets us infer 
that he is the posthumous son of some European potentate. The Duke and the 
courteous Horace Bellingham know who he is, but the reader's curiosity is not

  <summary author="Marlowe, Christopher (1564-1593)" title="The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus" print_title="The Tragical History\nof Doctor Faustus">DOCTOR FAUSTUS, by Christopher Marlowe. This play, written about the 
year 1589, is remarkable both as the chief work of the founder of English tragedy, 
and as the first play based on the Faust legend. At the time of the Reformation, 
when chemistry was in its infancy, any skill in this science was attributed to a compact with the Evil One.. Hence wandering scholars who performed tricks and wonders 
were considered magicians, their achievements were grossly exaggerated, and they 
were supposed to have surrendered their souls to the Devil. The last of these traveling magicians to gain notoriety was John Faustus, whose public career lasted from 
1510 to 1540; and to him were ascribed all the feats of his predecessors. In 1587 the 
'Faustbuch ' was printed, giving the story of his life and exploits. An English translation, made soon after, was doubtless the source of Marlowe's plot. The theme was 
afterwards variously elaborated in Germany, and there were many puppet plays on 
the subject; but it remained for Goethe's master-hand to ennoble the popular legend, 
and make it symbolic of the struggles and aspirations of the whole human race. 
Marlowe's 'Doctor Faustus ' is rather a tragic poem than a drama, consisting of only 
fourteen scenes without any grouping into acts. It is remarkable for singleness of 
aim and simplicity of construction, though there is plenty of variety and incident. 
The passionate and solemn scenes are very impressive, and the final tremendous 
monologue before Lucifer seizes Faustus's soul is unsurpassed in all the range of 
tragedy. Faustus, dissatisfied with philosophy, resolves to enlarge his sphere by
cultivating magic. He conjures up Mephistopheles and bids him be his servant, 
The spirit, however, replies that Lucifer's permission must first be gained. Faustus 
then voluntarily offers to surrender his soul after four-and-twenty years, if during 
that time Mephistopheles shall be his slave. Lucifer agrees, and demands a promise 
written in Faustus's blood. Then Faustus sets out in search of knowledge and 
pleasure, traveling about invisible. He provides grapes in midwinter, and calls up 
the spirits of Alexander and Thais to please the emperor. At the request of his 
scholars he summons Helen of Troy, and impressed by her beauty, exclaims: 

    "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships. 
    And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? 
    Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!" 

At times the desire for repentance seizes him; but the exhilaration of pleasure is too 
great, and the powers of ^evil are too strong. Finally the time expires, and Faustus in 
agony awaits the coming of Lucifer. He appeals to God and Christ, but has forfeited 
the right to pray; and at the stroke of twelve Lucifer bears him away to everlasting 
doom.</summary>

Dr. Jekyll is a physician of position and good character, a portly, kindly man. In 
his youth, however, he showed that he had strong capacities for evil, which he

quiet country life; and the interest of the book lies in the character studies, rather 
than in the plot. The scene is laid in the west of England about 1854. The heroine,
Mary Thome, is a sweet, modest girl, living with her kind uncle Doctor Thome, in 
the village of Greshambury, where Frank Gresham, the young heir of Greshambury 
Park, falls in love with her. The estate is incumbered; and as it is necessary that 
Frank should many for money, his mother, Lady Arabella, banishes Mary from the 
society of her daughters, and sends Frank to Courcy Castle, where he is expected to 
win the affections of Miss Dunstable, a wealthy heiress. He remains true to Mary, 
however; and after a year of enforced absence abroad, he returns and claims her for 
his wife in the face of every opposition. Roger Scatcherd, the brother of Mary's 
unfortunate mother, is creditor to Mr. Gresham for a sum of money amounting to 
the value of the entire estate. After his death his entire fortune falls to Mary Thorne; 
and the story concludes with the marriage of Frank and Mary, and a return of prosperity to Greshambury Park. 

The character of Doctor Thorne stands out vividly in the book as an independent, 
honest Englishman, offering a pleasing contrast to Lady Arabella with her conventionality and worldliness and the coarse vulgarity of Roger Scatcherd and his son.  </summary>

1879. It is the drama of the Woman, the product of man's fostering care through 
centuries, his doll, from whom nature has kindly removed the unused faculties 
which produce clear thinking and business-like action. Nora, the particular doll in 
question, adorns a little home with her pretty dresses, her pretty i lanner, her sweet, 
childish ignorance. She must bring up her babies, love her husband, and have well-cooked dinners. For the sake of this husband, she ventures once beyond the limit 
of the nest. He is ill, and she forges her rich father's name to obtain money to send 
him abroad. The disclosure of her guilt, the guilt of a baby, a doll who did not know 
better, brings her face to face with the realities of the world and of life. The puppet 
becomes vitalized, changed into a suffering woman who realizes that there is "something wrong" in the state of women as wives. She leaves her husband's house, "a 
moth flying towards a star." She will not return until she is different, or marriage 
is different, or she knows not what. 'A Doll's House' is the most striking embodiment in the range of modern drama, of the new awakening of Eve.</summary>

Mrs. Dombey, who has left her husband the proud possessor of a baby son and heir. 
He neglects his daughter Florence and loves Paul, in whom all his ambitions and 
worldly hopes are centred; but the boy dies. Mr. Dombey marries a beautiful 
woman, who is as cold and proud as he, and who has sold herself to him to escape 
from a designing mother. She grows fond of Florenpe, and this friendship is so displeasing to Mr. Dombey that he tries to humble her by remonstrating through Mr. 
Carker, his business manager and friend. This crafty villain, realizing his power, 
goads her beyond endurance, and she demands a separation from Mr. Dombey, but is 
refused. After an angry interview, she determines upon a bold stroke and disgraces 
her husband by pretending to elope with Carker to France, where she meets him once, 
shames and defies him and escapes. Mr. Dombey, after spurning Florence, whom he 
considers the cause of his trouble, follows Carker in hot haste. They encounter each 
other without warning at a railway station, and as Carker is crossing the tracks he 
falls and is instantly killed by an express train. Florence seeks refuge with an old 
sea-captain whom her little brother, Paul, has been fond of, marries Walter Gay, 
the friend of her childhood, and they go to sea. After the failure of Dombey and 
Son, when Mr. Dombey's pride is humbled and he is left desolate, Florence returns 
and takes care of him. The characters in the book not immediately concerned in the 
plot, but famous for their peculiar qualities, are Captain Cuttle, Florence's kind 
protector, who has a nautical manner of expression; Sol Gills, Walter's uncle; Mr. 
Toots, who suffers from shyness and love; and Joe Bagstock, the major. The scene 
is laid in England at the time the novel was published, in 1848.</summary>
  <summary author="Byron, George Gordon Byron, Baron (1788-1824)" title="Don Juan" print_title="Don Juan">DON JUAN, a narrative and satirical poem in eight-line stanzas by George Gordon, 
Lord Byron. Cantos I and II were published in 1819, III to V in 1821, VT-XIV at 
different times in 1823, and XV and XVI in 1824. The poem is unfinished. Its 
theme is the Spanish legend of Don Juan, a libertine who killed the father of a girl 
he had seduced and while on a mocking visit to his victim's tomb was swallowed up 
in Hell along with the statue of the man he had killed. Byron's Juan is also a libertine; but the poet is more interested in the varied amors of his hero and the opportunity afforded by them for pictures and reflections cynical, sentimental, and 
realistic of life and human nature, particularly the numerous aspects of love and 
passion than in drawing an edifying moral or providing for the punishment of the 
culprit. He had not decided, he said, whether to make him end in Hell or in an 
unhappy marriage. Don Juan a Spanish grandee of Seville is forced into exile at the 
age of sixteen through being detected in an intrigue with Donna Julia, the beautiful 
young wife of the elderly Don Alfonso. Embarking from Cadiz for Leghorn he is 
shipwrecked, and after enduring dreadful privations in an open boat is cast, the sole 
survivor, upon an island in the JEgean. Here he is secretly nursed back to life by 
Haidee, the lovely seventeen-year-old daughter of the pirate-chieftain, Lambro, and 
they become lovers. On a report that her father has died while absent on a piratical 
expedition, Haidee with Juan assumes the sovereignty of the island. But Lambro 
returns during a feast, surprises the lovers, disarms Juan, and sells him for a slave. 
While Haidee dies of a broken heart, Juan is taken to Constantinople, where he is 
purchased by the Sultana, Guyalbez, who lias fallen in love with him and introduces 
him, disguised as a woman, into the seraglio. Enraged at his rejection of her, and at 
a subsequent escapade with one of the women of the seraglio she orders Juan to be 
drowned. But he makes his escape to the Russian army, then fighting the Turks, 
distinguishes himself at a siege under General Souwaroff, and is sent as a special 
messenger to the notorious Empress Catherine at St. Petersburg. He becomes the 
reigning favorite and is then sent to England on a special diplomatic mission. Here 
Byron introduces the reader to a group of English aristocrats at a country house, 
where Juan is a guest; and ends in the midst of another amatory adventure, in which 
the Duchess of Fite-Fulke, masquerading as the ghost of a friar, seeks a midnight 
interview with the hero. The poem exhibits Byron's full power as a creative poet 
and a satirist. Perhaps the finest part is the account of the shipwreck, many details of which are taken from the autobiography of his grandfather, Admiral John Byron, 
and the ensuing episode of the love of Haidee and Juan.</summary>
  <summary author="Crawford, F. Marion (Francis Marion) (1854-1909)" title="Don Orsino" print_title="Don Orsino">DON ORSINO, by F. Marion Crawford (1892). This book gives a good idea of 
Rome after the unification of Italy, as the author's purpose is to describe a young 
man of the transition period. It will probably never attain the popularity of the 
two earlier Saracinesca stories, because many readers find the plot unpleasant and 
the ending unsatisfactory. In analysis and development of character, however, and 
in sparkling dialogue, it far surpasses its predecessors. 

Orsino Saracinesca longs for a career, and being rebuffed at home, is attracted 
by the sympathetic womanliness of Madame Maria Consuelo d'Aranjuez, whose 
antecedents are mysterious. With the aid of Del Ferice he undertakes some building 
operations, mortgaging his house in advance. One day he makes love to Madame 
d'Aranjuez, but soon realizes the shallowness of his emotions. Subsequently constant 
intercourse renews his affection on a firmer basis, and he wishes to marry her. Though 
she loves him she leaves Rome, soon writing that a stain on her birth prevents her 
marrying him. On the day of her refusal he learns that his business is ruined; but 
Del Ferice renews the contract in terms to which Orsino submits, only to avoid an 
appeal to his father. Thus he gets more and more into Del Ferice's power, until the 
united fortunes of the Saracinesca could hardly save him. At this crisis he receives 
from Maria Consuelo a friendly letter, asking merely that he tell her about himself. 
This he gladly does, writing freely of his business difficulties. Finally the bank releases him from his obligations, an action inexplicable until the announcement of 
Consuelo's marriage to Del Ferice. Then Orsino guesses, what he afterwards learns, 
that she has sold herself to save him. The story moves rapidly, the atmosphere is
strikingly Italian, and the various complications are well managed and interesting. </summary>

Miguel Cervantes, the first part of which appeared in 1605 and the second in 1615. 
A kindly and simple-minded country gentleman has read the romances of chivalry 
until they have turned his brain. Clad in a suit of old armor and mounted on a 
broken-down hack which he christens Rozinante, he sets out on a career of knight-errantry, assuming the name of Don Quixote de la Mancha. For the object of his 
devotion he chooses a village girl, whom he names Dulcinea del Toboso and as squire 
he takes an ignorant but faithful peasant, Sancho Panza. The ordinary wayfarers 
of the Spanish roads of the seventeenth century are transformed by the knight's 
disordered imagination into warriors, distressed damsels, giants, and monsters. 
For instance, he tilts on one occasion, at the sails of a group of wind-mills, thinking 
them living creatures, and his attempts to right fictitious wrongs and win chivalric 
honor among them lead him and his squire into ludicrous and painful situations. 
Yet amidst their discomfitures Don Quixote retains a dignity, a certain nobility, and 
a pathetic idealism, and Sancho a natural shrewdness and popular humor which 
endear them to the reader. In the second part the interest is fully sustained, and 
variety is introduced by the sojourn of the pair with a duke and duchess and Sancho's 
appointment as governor of the imaginary island of Baratoria. At the end, Don 
Quixote, as the result of a dangerous illness, recovers his senses, renounces all books 
of chivalry, and dies penitent. The book was begun as an attack on the absurdities 
of the late chivalric romances, not on the essential chivalric ideals. As the work 
progresses it becomes a picture of human nature, its absurdities and its aspirations, 
its coarse materialism and lofty enthusiasm. The best English translations are 
Shelton's (1612-1620) reprinted with an introduction by J. Fitzmaurice- Kelly in the 
'Tudor Translations,' 4 vols., 1896, and that by John Ormsby, 1885, reprinted with

  <summary author="Pérez Galdós, Benito (1843-1920)" title="Dona Perfecta" print_title="Dona Perfecta">DONA PERFECTA, by Benito Perez Gald6s. This exquisite romance, the translation of which was published in 1880, is a vivid description of life in a Spanish provincial town, just before the Carlist war. Dona Perfecta Rey de Polentinos is a 
wealthy widow, just in all her dealings, kind and charitable, but a perfect type of the 
narrow-minded and even cruel spirit of old Spain. The Spanish hate the national 
government, but have a peculiar local patriotism, which in this case turns an apparently kind and honorable woman against her own nephew, because he dislikes the 
customs of her beloved town. 

This nephew, Don Jose Rey, handsome, generous, and rich, is the hero of the 
story, whose incidents are the outgrowth of old prejudice religious and political. 

The author endeavors to show that the offenses of Dona Perfecta are the result 
of her position and surroundings rather than inherent in her character. In this book 
he begins to exploit the modern Spain and its clashing interests. He brings "the new 
and the old face to face," to use the words of Professor Marsh: "the new in the form 
of a highly-trained, clear-thinking, frank-speaking modern man; the old in the guise 
of a whole community so remote from the current of things that its religious intolerance, its social jealousy, its undisturbed confidence and pride in itself, must of 
necessity declare instant war upon that which comes from without, unsympathetic 
and critical. The inevitable result is ruin for the party whose physical force is less, 
the single individual; yet hardly less complete ruin for those whom intolerance and 
hate have driven to the annihilation of their adversary." The story was published 
in 1876, and reached its ninth edition in 1896.</summary>

as a poor student seeking a situation, he reaches the town of Auchars, where he meets 
a spiritually minded cobbler and his wife with whom he lodges. In Auchars he finds 
a field of work, and the story deals with the effect produced on careless and selfish 
characters by contact with an upright and generous nature. The plot involves a 
forced marriage, and other well-known incidents; but the book shows all Macdonald's 
familiar qualities, though it is less eventful and more didactic than many of his stories.</summary>

"The Duchess of Malfi," says Mr. Edmund Gosse "has finer elements of tragedy than 
exist elsewhere outside the works of Shakespeare." The Duchess of Malfi, a widow, 
falls in love with and marries Antonio Bologna, steward of her household. Her 
brothers, the Cardinal and Ferdinand, Duke of Calabria, incensed at her for thus 
dishonoring the family, pursue her with every form of vindictiveness. They cause 
her to be banished from Ancona, where she and her husband and children had taken 
sanctuary at the shrine of our Lady of Loretto. Daniel de Bosola, the Duchess's own 
gentleman of the horse, who is used as a spy and tool by her brothers, is sent to tell 
her that she must be parted from her husband. The fourth act is a crescendo of 
horrors. Ferdinand gives to the Duchess the hand of her dead husband, wearing 
the ring she gave him. Eight madmen are let loose to dance round her without 
shaking her resolution. "I am Duchess of Malfi still, " she proudly says to the tool 
Bosola. Preparations for her own violent death are made in her presence, her coffin 
brought in and a dirge sung before she is strangled. Her children, and Cariola, her 
faithful servant and confidante, suffer a like fate. Even Ferdinand, who with diabolic cruelty had ordered her death is seized with penitent horror. "Cover her face: 
mine eyes dazzle: she died young," he cries. Ferdinand goes mad, Bosola stabs the 
Cardinal, and Bosola receives his death wound from Ferdinand, but kills his assailant. 
The last words of Ferdinand were: 

    " Whether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust 
    Like diamonds we are cut with our own dust."

mentary by Hugh Walpole (1914). This novel pictures the social system of the
Victorian era, which ended with the South African war. The duchess and her class 
believed England's greatness depended on government by a few blue-blooded autocrats, the clear-headed despots managing the muddle-headed majority. As head of 
the Beaminster clan, the last of the autocrats, she ruled by the power of tradition, 
and by continual ceremony, pomp, and circumstance. For thirty years the duchess, 
had not left her room; invisible to the world, she sat in magnificence in her Oriental'
chair, flanked by two Chinese dragons, and tyrannized over her family and friends,
the Beaminster clan. The enemies within her gates were the rising generation, her 
two grandchildren, both children of misalliances, in whom the Beaminster tradition is 
at war with a freer spirit. Rachel, her hated granddaughter, feels the terrible old lady's 
power and fears her, but still refuses to be dominated and insists on thinking for 
herself. To gain freedom she marries her friend Sir Roderick, one of the Beaminster 
circle, and a favorite of her grandmother's. Soon after their marriage his flirtation 
with one of her guests brings about their estrangement. The fascination of her 
forbidden friendship with her cousin, Francis, the outcast grandson, almost brings 
her to disaster. She is about to leave her husband to go to him, when Sir Roderick 
is thrown from his horse and laid on his back for life. It has been a marriage of 
convenience on both sides, but Sir Roderick has fallen in love with his wife, and his 
illness and the expectation of a child awakes her love for him. As Rachel's happiness 
is assured, and the grandson, Francis Beaminster, is recognized by the family without 
the knowledge of the duchess, the guns of the South African war mark the beginning 
of democracy, and the duchess dies as her world slips from her dominion. </summary>
  <summary author="Balzac, Honoré de (1799-1850)" title="The Duchesse of Langeais" print_title="The Duchesse of Langeais">DUCHESSE DE LANGEAIS, THE, by Balzac (1834), analyzes carefully the Faubourg Saint-Germain, or the aristocracy of Paris under the Restoration. In a most 
logical and impartial way, Balzac explains how the patrician class loses its natural 
ascendency when it does not produce the results its advantage of birth and training 
warrant. After learning that the "Great Lady" had no influence on the morals of 
the time, that she was hypocritical and artificially educated, it is not to be expected 
that the heroine of the story, the Duchesse de Langeais, will prove an anomaly of 
virtue. Parisian to the core, the young duchess lives in the luxury of the boudoir 
and the fickle gayety of the ball-room. She is characterized as "supremely a woman 
and supremely a coquette." Unhampered by her husband, who lives his military 
life apart, the duchess feels free to attach to her suite numberless young men, whom 
she encourages and repulses by turns. In Armand de Montriveau, however, she 
finds at last a man of pride and strong will, as well as an ardent lover. He no sooner 
discovers that Madame is trifling with his affection than he resolves to have his 
revenge. He arranges an interview, brings the duchess face to face with herself, and 
denounces her as a murderer, on the ground that she has slain his happiness and his 
faith and bids her farewell. The duchess immediately falls in love with him, 
sends him repentant letters which receive no response, and after a desperate attempt 
to see him in his own house, leaves Paris just as Monsieur is hastening to call upon her. 
Armand de Montriveau searches five years for his lady, finding her at last immured 
in a convent in Spain. Determined to rescue her from such an imprisonment, he 
succeeds in penetrating to the cell of her who was called by the nuns "Sister Therese," 
only to find the dead body of the Duchesse de Langeais. This is one of the most 
famous of Balzac's novels. .The story is told with all his vigor and minuteness, and 
the characters impress themselves on the memory as persons actually known.</summary>

degradation and misery of garrison life in a frontier town. The officers are brutal, 
drunken beasts, unmercifully cruel to the soldiers, who Hve in a slavish state of 
abject terror. The central character, i sub-lieutenant Romashov, is the typical 
Russian hero of the Russian novel, a talker, a sentimental dreamer with high ideals 
but without will-power. In day-dreams he sees himself performing glorious deeds of 
valor before an admiring world. At the review, the great official event of the year, 
while he loses himself in romantic visions of promotion, his company is thrown into
hopeless confusion by his absent-minded blunders, and he is subjected to a public 
reprimand. Nasanki, a drunken officer who is the mouthpiece of the author, bitterly 
arraigns militarism which makes men low-minded debauchees, "ready for every 
villainy and cruelty. " Romashov longs to escape from this dreary society with its 
petty intrigue, petty jealousy, and petty social ambition. He had a liaison with a 
vulgar married woman, but eventually falls genuinely in love with the beautiful, 
heartless Shurochka, married to a stupid husband whose advancement through the staff 
examinations is her great ambition. She is willing to amuse herself with the boyish 
sub-lieutenant's chivalrous devotion, but the time comes when she must choose and 
she sacrifices him to her ambition. The woman whom he has left for Shurochka's 
sake spreads scandal about them until there is open enemity between Shurochka's 
husband and Romashov, and a duel is arranged. Shurochka tells Romashov that 
the duel must be without risk to either of them. He assents, and is killed by her 
husband as she planned, in order that the affair may not be a stumbling-block in the 
way of her husband's future, which is her own hope of escape from the odious provincial town. The story was translated in an abridged version in 1907 with the title

both Archibald Carlyle and Francis Levison; the former as noble as the latter is base. 
She marries Carlyle, but is persuaded by Levison that her husband is unfaithful to

reveals Levison to be a murderer, and discloses to Carlyle the identity of Isabel, 
whom he has thought dead. Her sufferings break her heart, and upon her death-bed 
she receives his full forgiveness. The plot, though impossible, is well managed and 
made to seem credible, and there are several strong and touching situations. The 
dominant tone of the book is distinctly minor. Although it has little literary merit, it 
secured immediate popularity, has been through many editions on two continents, and

wounded and wins commendation for his bravery. Through all his experiences Eben 
Holden is his staunch friend and does everything in his power to bring about his 
happiness and prosperity, his unselfishness and kindliness being shown on every 
occasion. Eben is also instrumental in bringing about the union of David Brower 
and his son Nehemiah, who had left his home in his youth and had been mourned as 
dead for many years; he returns to his parents a rich man, able to make them comfortable in their declining years. The quaint and original stories and sayings of 
Eben Holden make up a large part of the book, and the creation of his character is a 
distinct contribution to American fiction.</summary>

monumental (1) in the extent, faithfulness, care in statement, love of truth, and 
pleasant style, of its report from all trustworthy sources of the history (not merely 
ecclesiastical) of Britain, and especially of England, down to the eighth century; and 
(2) in its being the only authority for important church and other origins and developments through the whole period. Bseda was by far the most learned Englishman 
of his time; one of the greatest writers known to English literature; in a very high 
sense "the Father of English History"; an extensive compiler for English use from 
the writings of the Fathers of the Church; an author of treatises representing the 
existing knowledge of science; and a famous English translator of Scripture. In high 
qualities of genius and rare graces of character, he was in the line of Shakespeare. 
From one of his young scholars, Cuthbert, we have a singularly beautiful story of the 
venerable master's death, which befell about 735 A. D., when he was putting the last 
touches to his translation of the Fourth Gospel. From his seventh year, 680, to the 
day of his death, May 26, 735, he passed his life in the Benedictine abbey, first at 
Wearmouth and then at Jarrow; but it was a life of immense scholarly and educational 
activity. Green's 'History' says of him: "First among English scholars, first among 
English theologians, first among English historians, it is in the monk of Jarrow that 
English literature strikes its roots. In the six hundred scholars who gathered round 
him for instruction, he is the father of our national education." It was in point of 
view and name only that Baeda's great work was an ecclesiastical history. It covered 
all the facts drawn from Roman writers, from native chronicles and biographies, 
from records and public documents, and from oral and written accounts by his contemporaries. It was written in Latin; first printed at Strasburg about 1473; King 
Alfred translated it into Anglo-Saxon; and it has had several editions and English 
versions in recent times. The whole body of Baeda's writings, some forty in number, 
show his unwearied industry in learning, teaching, and writing, his gentle and cultivated feelings, his kindly sympathies, and the singular freshness of mind which gave 
life and beauty to so many pages of his story of England's past.</summary>

kingdom. Earl Lancaster and the elder and younger Mortimer are incensed at 
Edward's infatuation for his favorite. In spite of the displeasure of his nobles, Edward bestows upon Gaveston the castle and rents of the Bishop of Coventry, who 
had previously been the chief cause of Gaveston's being sent into exile. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the nobles, the counsellors of the King, force Edward to 
banish Gaveston. Edward in pique becomes estranged from his Queen, Isabella, 
whom he accuses of familiarity with Mortimer, but sends Gaveston to be governor of 
Ireland. The Queen, anxious to win back the favor of the King, induces the nobles 
to consent to the repeal of Gaveston's banishment; but when Gaveston returns, he is 
received with satirical greetings by the nobles, headed by Warwick and the younger 
Mortimer, who seize him and keep him under arrest. In the meantime the King of 
France had seized Normandy, and Isabella and her son, who were sent to France on a 
mission of appeasement, returned without having accomplished their ends. In 
their absence the Spencers had come to the aid of Edward, who captured certain of 
the nobles. Others joined the Queen on her return and Edward was forced to resign 
his crown. The growing horror and pathos of the closing scenes which describe the

immense literature to which our vast new knowledge of the long-buried Egypt has 
given rise. With its many new facts and new views and interpretations, gleaned by 
M. Maspero with his unrivaled facilities as director of the great Boulak Museum at 
Cairo, the volume is, for the general reader and the student, the most adequate of 
text-books and handbooks of its subject.</summary>
  <summary author="Ward, Humphry, Mrs. (1851-1920)" title="Eleanor" print_title="Eleanor">ELEANOR, by Mrs. Humphry Ward, was published in 1900. The real interest of 
this book is not so much in its plot as in the development of the character of its heroine 
Eleanor Bargoyne, a woman of rare charm and of supreme intellectual endowment, 
who comes to Rome for the benefit of her health. She has had a brief and unhappy 
married life which has ended with the death of husband and child, since when she has 
for eight years been absorbed in the world of books. In Rome, she is brought into 
close companionship with her cousin Edward Manisty, with whom she falls devotedly 
in love. He is thoroughly self-centred and egotistical, moody and taciturn, and 
possesses insufferable manners. Despite her frail health, Eleanor throws herself body 
and soul into the endeavor to aid Manisty in the production of a successful book; she 
spends long and exhausting hours discussing, copying, and advising, and acts as an 
intellectual stimulus for his powers and perceptions. The introduction of Lucy 
Foster upon the scene, and an adverse criticism upon his book, bring about a change 
in Manisty f s attitude towards Eleanor; he falls in love with the pretty young American girl and his cousin realizes that he has not a thought for her. She at first attempts 
to separate the lovers, and Lucy, loyal to the older woman, and true to the promptings of her Puritan conscience, rejects the advances of Manisty, and leaves Rome 
with Eleanor, whose health, impaired by the emotional and physical strain she has 
experienced, is gradually failing. After much suffering and a violent mental struggle, 
Eleanor rises above her own feelings and exerts her influence to bring about the union 
of the lovers, whose marriage she survives but by a few months.</summary>
  <summary author="Von Arnim, Elizabeth (1866-1941)" title="Elizabeth and Her German Garden" print_title="Elizabeth\nand\nHer German Garden">ELIZABETH AND HER GERMAN GARDEN, by Countess Von Arnim (later 
Countess Russell) appeared anonymously in 1898, Elizabeth, a young married 
woman, tired of city life, persuades her husband to move into the country where 
they have an old family estate, which is rapidly going to decay.  The opening pages 
describe in a most breezy and delightful way her first experience in bringing order out 
of chaos. She goes in advance of her family to the old house, accompanied by a 
housekeeper and a servant, and oversees the workman and gardeners, who are making 
the place habitable. Elizabeth who is a true lover of nature, finds perfect enjoyment 
in her out-of-door life, and her ecstasy and delight over her garden forms the motive 
of the tale. After some weeks spent entirely in communing with nature, she is joined 
by her family, and her journal then depicts their idyllic home life in the country. Her 
husband, whom she laughingly calls the "Alan of Wrath," and her three children, 
designated severally as the "April," "May" and "June" babies, figure frequently in 
the pages of her journal. The trials she endures from unwelcome guests, stupid 
servants, and a disagreeable governess, are amusingly described, as are the minute 
details of her experimental gardening. The author's enthusiasm for nature, and keen 
knowledge of humanity makes the book both entertaining and agreeable reading. 
It is delightful in style, and Elizabeth muses, laughs, and moralizes over her garden, 
her husband, her babies, and her acquaintances in a peculiarly feminine way in which 
is blended humor, simplicity, shrewdness, and philosophy. </summary>
  <summary author="Holmes, Oliver Wendell (1809-1894)" title="Elsie Venner" print_title="Elsie Venner">ELSIE VENNER, by Oliver Wendell Holmes, was first published serially, in 1859-60, under the name of 'The Professor's Story.' The romance is a study in heredity, 
introducing a peculiar series of phenomena closely allied to such dualism of nature 
as may best be described by the word "ophianthropy." Delineations of the characters, social functions, and religious peculiarities of a New England village, form a 
setting for the story. Elsie Venner is a young girl whose physical and psychical 
peculiarities occasion much grief and perplexity to her father, a widower of gentle 
nature and exceptional culture. The victim of some pre-natal casualty, Elsie shows 
from infancy unmistakable traces of a serpent-nature intermingling with her higher 
self. This nature dies within her only when she yields to an absorbing love. Like all 
the work of Dr. Holmes, the story is brilliantly written and full of epigrammatic 
sayings; it is acute though harsh in dissection of New England life, and distinguished 
by psychological insight and the richest humor.</summary>
  <summary author="Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1712-1778)" title="Émile; Or, Concerning Education; Extracts" print_title="Émile;\nOr,\nConcerning Education">EMILE, by Jean Jacques Rousseau, the most famous of pedagogic romances, was 
composed in 1762. Its immediate effect was to call down on his head the denunciations of the Archbishop of Paris, who found him animated "by a spirit of insubordination and revolt," and to exile him for some years from France. Its lasting effect 
was to lay the foundation of modern pedagogy. Due to the suggestion of a mother 
who asked advice as to the training of a child, it was the expansion of his opinions 
and counsels;^ the framework of a story sustaining an elaborate system of elementary 
education. Emile, its diminutive hero, is reared apart from other children under a 
tutor, by a long series of experiments conducted by the child himself, often with 
painful consequences. Little by little, his childish understanding comes to comprehend at first-hand the principles of physics, mechanics, gardening, property, and 
morals. At last the loosely woven plot leads to the marriage of Emile with Sophie, a 
girl who has been educated in a similar fashion. Arbitrary, but always ingenious 
and stimulating, the experiments introduced are veritable steps of knowledge. As
object-lessons, the altercation with the gardener and the visit to the mountebank are 
unsurpassed in the simplicity with which the complex ideas of property and magnetism are presented to a developing intelligence. From the hints contained in 'Emile,' 
Basedow, Pestalozzi, and Froebel drew their inspiration and laid the broad foundations of modern elementary education. Unsystematic, sometimes impracticable, 
full of suggestion, it invests the revolutionary ideas of its author with his customary 
literary charm.</summary>
  <summary author="Brandes, Georg (1842-1927)" title="Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century Literary Portraits" print_title="Eminent Authors\nof the\nNineteenth Century\nLiterary Portraits">EMINENT AUTHORS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, translated from the 
Danish of Brandes by Rasmus B. Anderson (1882), is a collection of nine critical 
essays, "literary portraits," from the German, Danish, English, French, Swedish, 
and Norwegian literatures. "In all of them," says the author, "the characteristics 
of the individual are so chosen as to bring out the most important features of the 
author's life and works." In a close and brilliant analysis, influenced by Taine's 
method of reference to race, environment, and moment, Brandes develops what was 
most individual in the production of each. His subjects are all men whose maturest 
productions appeared during the middle or earlier half of the century, and exercised 
a formative influence upon modern literature. He shows the German poet Heyse 
abandoning traditional methods of thought to follow "the voice of instinct," and 
thus inaugurating the reign of individuality. 

Hans Christian Andersen is the discoverer of the child in Northern literature, 
the man with the rare gift of viewing nature with childlike eyes; John Stuart Mill is 
the strong yet insular Englishman with a "matter-of-fact mind" which made him 
intolerant of German mysticism, yet wearing an "invisible nimbus of exalted love of 
truth"; Renan is the patient philosopher, hater of the commonplace, lover of the 
unfindable ideal, "a spectator in the universe"; Tegne is the humanistic lyrist of 
the North; Flaubert the painful seeker after perfection of form; the Danish Paludan-Muller, a poet, who with a satiric realization of earthly discords, clings to orthodox 
religious ideals; Bjornson, the poet-novelist of Norway, is the cheerful practical 
patriot, loving and serving his people in daily life; while his fellow-countryman Henrik 
Ibsen is the literary pathologist of the North, who diagnoses social evils without 
attempting to offer a remedy. The fact that they were all modern in spirit, all longed 
to express what is vital or of universal application has made their work as valuable to 
foreign readers as to their own countrymen. Its local color and feeling endeared it at 
home, and heightened its charm abroad.</summary>
  <!--<summary author="Austen, Jane (1775-1817)" title="Emma" print_title="Emma">EMMA, by Jane Austen. The story of 'Emma' is perhaps one of the simplest in all 
fiction, but the genius of Miss Austen manifests itself throughout. All her books 
show keen insight into human nature; but in 'Emma' the characters are so true to 
life, and the descriptions so vivid, that for the time one positively lives in the village 
of Highbury, the scene of the tale. At the opening of the story, Emma Woodhouse, 
the heroine, "handsome, clever, and rich," and somewhat spoilt by a weak fussy 
father, lives alone with him. Her married sister's brother-in-law, Mr. Knightley, is 
a frequent visitor at their house; as is Mrs. Weston, Emma's former governess. Mr. 
Knighttey is a quiet, sensible English gentleman, the only one who tells Emma her 
faults. Finding life dull, Emma makes friends with Harriet Smith, an amiable, 
weak-minded young girl, and tries to arrange a match between her and Mr. Elton, the 
clergyman, but fails. Frank Churchill Mrs. Weston's stepson arrives in the 
village, pays marked attention to Emma, and supplies the town with gayety and 
gossip. Shortly after his departure, a letter brings the news of Hs rich, aunt's death, 
and his own secret engagement to Jane Fairfax, a beautiful girl in Highbury: Emma 
suspects Harriet of being in love with Mr. Churchill, but discovers that she cherishes 
instead a hidden affection for Mr. Knightley. The disclosure fills Emma with alarm, 
and she realizes for the first time that no one but herself must marry him. Fortunately he has long loved her; and the story ends with her marriage to him, that of 
Harriet to Mr. Martin, her rejected lover, and of Jane to Frank Churchill. 

The gradual evolution of her better self in Emma, and her unconscious admiration 
for Mr. Knightley *s quiet strength of character, changing from admiration to love 
as she herself grows, is exceedingly interesting. Chief among the other characters 
are Mr. Woodhouse, a nervous invalid with a permanent fear of colds, and a taste 
for thin gruel; and talkative Miss Bates, who flits from one topic of conversation to 
another like a distracted butterfly. Less brilliant than 'Pride and Prejudice,' 
'Emma' is equally rich in humor, in the vivid portraiture of character, and a never-ending delight in human absurdities, which the fascinated reader shares from chapter 
to chapter. It was published in 1816, when Jane Austen was forty-one. </summary>-->
  <summary author="Disraeli, Benjamin, Earl of Beaconsfield (1804-1881)" title="Endymion" print_title="Endymion">ENDYMION, by Benjamin Disraeli, later Earl of Beaconsfield (1835). This is one 
of a series of political portraits under the form of a novel, which for a time attained 
great popularity among the English people, but for obvious reasons was less interesting to foreigners. 'Coningsby' and 'Endymion' are hardly more than descriptions 
of the rival political parties in England at the opening of the Reform Bill agitation, 
and of the Poor Law and "Protection" controversies, colored with the pale 
glimmer of a passion cooled by shrewdness, and of a romance carefully trimmed to 
suit the stiff conventionalisms of English society, and spiced with revenge on the 
author's foes. 

'Endymion' relates the fortunes of a youth so named, and his sister Myra; 
children of one William Ferrars, who from humble life has won his way'to a candidacy 
for the Speakership of the House of Commons, when suddenly, by a change 'of political sentiment in the boroughs, the administration is overthrown, and'tne'aitfbitious 
and flattered leader finds himself both deserted and bankrupt. To retrieve their 
social and political position is the steady ambition and never-yielding effort of the 
son and daughter; and to Endymion's advancement Myra makes every sacrifice 
that a sister's devotion can devise. Through personal influence as well as his own 
fascinating personality and brilliant gifts, Endymion finds an entry with the winning 
side; and being untroubled by any scrupulous motive of consistency to principle, 
keeps himself at the front in popular favor. Myra marries the Prime Minister, and at 
his death she takes for her husband the king of a small Continental State. Endymion crowns her aspirations by marrying a widow in high station, who has long been 
his admirer, and whose husband dies at a convenient moment in the narrative. At 
the close of the story he sees, by a happy combination of political influence, the door 
opened to his own appointment as Premier of England. The story moves along in the 
stately monotonous measure of English high life, with not even any pronounced 
villainy to heighten the uniform color effect of the characters and incidents. There 
is a noticeable absence of anything like high patriotic motive associated with that of 
personal advancement: it is difficult to conceive of such personages living without 
some political predilection. Over all is the subdued glow of an intensely selfish 
culture and refinement. Nigel, Endymion's student friend at Oxford, is the easily 
recognized type of the Puseyite of the Tractarian religious movement, if not a personal portraiture of Cardinal Newman. Other characters are doubtless drawn from 
life more or less plainly, but none more vividly than Endymion himself, in whose 
career the reader sees outlined very clearly the character and political fortunes of the 
author.</summary>
  <summary author="Emerson, Ralph Waldo (1803-1882)" title="English Traits" print_title="English Traits">ENGLISH TRAITS, by Ralph Waldo Emerson (1856), comprises an account of his 
English visits in 1833 and 1847, and a series of general observations on national 
character. It is the note-book of a philosophic traveler. In the earlier chapters, the 
sketches of his visits to Coleridge, Carlyle, and Wordsworth, while personal in some 
degree, reveal Emerson's character and humor in a delightful way. The trend of his 
mind to generalization is evident in the titles given to the chapters. With the exception of 'Stonehenge' and 'The Times,' they are all abstract, 'Race,' 'Ability,' 
'Character,' 'Wealth,' or 'Religion,' far removed from provincialism, the tone is 
that of a beholder, kindred in race, who, while paying due respect to the stock from 
which he sprang, feels his own eyes purged of certain illusions still cherished by the 
Old World. These playthings, as it were, of a full-grown people, the court and 
church ceremonial, thrones, mitres, bewigged officials, Lord Mayor's shows, 
amused the observer. "Every one of these islanders is an island himself, safe, tranquil, incommunicable." This work remains unique as a searching analysis, full of 
generous admiration, of a foreign nation's racial temperament, by a strongly original 
individuality.</summary>
  <summary author="Seebohm, Frederic" title="The English Village Community" print_title="The\nEnglish Village\nCommunity">ENGLISH VILLAGE COMMUNITY, THE, by F. Seebohm (1883). The question 
propounded in this book is whether English Economic History began with the freedom or the serfdom of the masses of the people, whether the village communities 
were free or lived in serfdom under a manorial lordship. The problem is of wider 
interest than might appear on the surface because (1) the English and German land 
systems were the same, and there are also fundamental analogies between the village 
communities of the Eastern and the Western worlds, and (2) because on the answer 
to the question ma} r depend the attitude of modern statesmen to the solution of 
present-day problems of social and political freedom. After a careful examination 
of the available evidence Mr. Seebohm is of the opinion that "the manorial system 
grew up in Britain as it grew up in Gaul and Germany, as the compound product of 
barbarian and Roman institutions mixing together during the periods first of Roman 
provincial rule, and secondly of German conquest." Throughout the whole period 
from pre-Roman to modern times there were in Britain two parallel systems of rural 
economy, the village community in the east, the tribal in the west, each of which were 
distinguished by the characteristics of community and equality, though their systems 
of open or common fields were different. Neither the village nor the tribal community can have been introduced later than 2000 years ago. The village community 
lived in settled serfdom under a lordship, though this serfdom was to the masses of the 
people, not a degradation, but a step upward out of a once more general slavery. 
The tribal community was bound together by an equality of blood relationship, which 
involved an equal division of land amongst the sons of tribesmen. "The fundamental 
principle of the new economic order," says Mr. Seebohm, "seems to be opposed to the 
community and equality of the old order in both its forms. The freedom of the 
individual and growth of individual enterprise and property which mark the new 
order imply a rebellion against the bonds of the communism and forced equality, 
alike of the manorial and of the tribal system. It has triumphed by breaking up both 
the communism of serfdom and the communism of the free tribe." It would seem, 
however, that the Great War may annihilate, or for a time submerge, the individualist economic order.</summary>

William Kinglake ( 1844). 'Eothen' a title meaning 'From the Dawn' is a lively 
and acute narrative of travel in the East, at a time when that region was comparatively new ground to English tourists. The author, starting from Constantinople, 
visits the Troad, Cyprus, the Holy Land, Cairo, the Pyramids, and the Sphinx; 
thence by the way of Suez he proceeds to Gaza, and returns by the way of Nablous 
and Damascus. He apologizes for his frankness of style, and gives his impressions 
with refreshing directness, modified as little as possible by conventional opinion. 
For this reason he provoked some criticism from conservative reviewers, who regarded his comments on the manners and morals of Mohammedan countries as too 
liberal to be encouraged in Christian circles. He confesses his inability to overcome a 
very worldly mood even in Jerusalem, and his failure to see things always in that 
light of romance that the reader might prefer; and he is unwilling that his own moral 
judgment shall stand in the way of a perfectly truthful narrative. Instances of his 
engaging style are the interview with the Pasha through the dragoman at the start, 
and his description of the Ottoman lady, "a coffin-shaped bundle of white linen." 

The incident of Mariam, a Christian bride converted to Islam, is full of humor, and 
contains a dash of that liberalism which roused the fears of the Christian critics.</summary>
  <summary author="Jonson, Ben" title="Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman" print_title="Epicoene;\nOr,\nThe Silent Woman">EPICENE; or THE SILENT WOMAN, by Ben Jonson (1609). This work, which to 
many critics recalls the manner of Moliere, was said by Coleridge to be "the most 
entertaining of Jonson's comedies." The plot turns upon an audacious trick which 
the author plays upon his hearers. The chief character, Morose, a misanthrope who 
hates every kind of noise, "Cutbeard" (he says to his barber), "thank me not but 
with thy leg," is subjected to a series of trials, each of which jars upon him more 
than the former. He marries someone whom he believes to be a silent woman, but 
who turns out to be a chatterbox and ultimately proves to be a boy in disguise. Sir 
John Daw, another character, criticizes great classic names with audacious freedom 
and pretense of literary taste. Aristotle is "a mere commonplace fellow"; Plato, 
"a discoursed'; Homer, an "old tedious, prolix ass," who "talks of curriers and chines 
of beef." His own constantly repeated oath is, "As I hope to finish Tacitus." 
Another, Sir Amorous La Foole, boasts that he belongs to "as ancient a family as any 
is in Europe," but regretfully adds, "antiquity is not respected now." Truewit 
directs the intrigue and, to admiration, plays off the characters against one another. 
The vivacity of the fun and the interest of the plot increase from act to act, until the 
fifth comes with its completely unexpected denouement.</summary>
  <summary author="Emerson, Ralph Waldo (1803-1882)" title="Essays" print_title="Essays">ESSAYS, by Ralph Waldo Emerson. The First Series, published in 1841, included 
essays on History, Self -Reliance, Compensation, Spiritual Laws, Love, Friendship, 
Prudence, Heroism, The Over-Soul, Circles, Intellect, and Art. The essays of the 
Second Series (1844) are: The Poet, Experience, Character, Manners, Gifts, Nature, 
Politics, Nominalist and Realist, and New England Reformers. Many of the essays 
were first delivered in the form of addresses and have, partly on that account, mainly 
because of the writer's temperament, a desultoriness of method and a tendency to 
create attention by keen epigrams and suggestive aphorisms rather than to present 
a subject in coherent order. Moreover, Emerson preferred intuition to reasoning 
and cared little for logical presentation but was eager to stimulate thought by flashes 
of insight and to inspire resolution by arresting emotional appeals. His main ideas 
are the immanence of God and the supreme importance of the individual. Transcendental and idealistic in his entire outlook on life he has no patience with mechanistic or materialistic opinions, with pessimistic or Calvinistic views of human nature, 
with passive or cowardly submission to commonly accepted tenets or practices. 
That man may make his own happiness anywhere and everywhere by opening his 
eyes to the goodness and beauty around him and by being true to himself is the view 
of this practical philosopher, who unites a Yankee shrewdness with an almost oriental 
mysticism. The style of the essays is somewhat abrupt and disconnected, but plain, 
pure, and unaffected in diction, with a vein of sinewy strength running through its 
homely, straightforward sentences.</summary>

Esther Waters, a member of the narrow religious sect of the Plymouth Brethren, 
takes her first situation in a horse-racing household in the country. The master 
owns winning horses, and the servants quarrel over their sweepstakes. The mistress 
belongs to the Plymouth Brethren, and therefore takes a special interest in her new 
kitchenmaid. The dashing footman, William, makes love to Esther, and then deserts 
her to elope with a rich young cousin of the family. Esther is dismissed from the 
house when it is discovered that she will soon be a mother. Her drunken stepfather 
takes most of her money from her, and when she is turned out of the hospital before 
she is able to work, she has to leave her baby with a baby-farmer and go out as a wet-nurse. She finds that the woman is letting her baby die of neglect and gives up her 
place and goes to the workhouse to keep her baby. The book is the story of Esther's 
plucky devoted maternity. By hard struggle she manages to support her boy. A 
young man becomes her friend and brings her again to the Plymouth Brethren. 
Just as they are going to be married, William turns up again, a bookmaker and keeper 
of a public house. He wins her from the marriage, because he is able to provide for 
her child. She goes to live with him, and after his divorce, they are married and 
very happy. There is illegal betting in the bar parlor, and William is fined and loses 
his license. He becomes ill from exposure in bad weather at the races and dies leaving 
Esther with nothing. She almost has to go to the workhouse again. Her first mistress, 
who is a widow and alone, takes her back, and helps support Esther's son until he is a 
fine young soldier. This novel pictures the evil results of betting among the British 
working class, the language and habits of the lower sporting world, and the horrors 
of baby-farming and lying-in hospitals. Its method is severely realistic.</summary>

Roselli. He rescues from the snow, a street waif, David Leone, who is one of the

Bonelli, Secretary of State, and a man of cunning and duplicity, who brings her to 
Rome where she becomes the reigning belle of the capital, but one whose name has 
not remained untarnished. The author recounts her meeting with David Rossi, her 
recognition of her foster brother, their love and the various obstacles which beset 
their path. In 'The Eternal City' Mr. Caine has presented a sociological study 
with a strong element of love-making in it. Through the efforts of a humanizing

invalid, whose imaginary ailments thrive on patent medicines. He makes a bare 
living from the stony soil of the little farm. His wife refuses to be transplanted to 
the town where there are "lectures and big libraries and 'fellows doing things'" 
and a chance for congenial work for Ethan. A girl cousin of his wife's, left destitute, 
comes to live with them, bringing brightness and cheer and inevitably, love of youth 
for youth. Zenia goes away on one of her "therapeutic excursions" and Ethan and 
Mattie have a happy time keeping house together. When Zenia returns she announces that the doctor had advised her to save her health by getting a strong hired 
girl to do the work and there is no room for Mattie any longer. Ethan is helpless. 
"There were no means by which he could compel her to keep the girl under her roof." 
The friendship of Mattie and Ethan has apparently aroused her jealousy, and from a 
"state of sullen self-absorption she is transformed into an active mysterious alien 
presence" holding him in her power through his honesty and sense of duty. Ethan 
and Mattie speak their love for each other in the despair of parting. Driving to the 
station they yield to the impulse to coast once more down the long hill to the village, 
a steep breathless rush with a great elm at the foot, to be avoided by quick steering 
at the last minute. The temptation comes to Ethan to run into the elm and end it all, 
rather than to live apart. The girl agrees, but the fates are against them. They live 
on, she helpless with a broken back, and he crippled, both tied beyond escape to 
Zenia and the slow starvation of the barren farm.</summary>

pallid dwelling" at Saumur where they live. Father Grandet loves his wife and 
daughter, but loves his money better, and cannot spare enough of it to supply his 
family with suitable food and clothing. His rare gifts to his wife he usually begs back,

handsome cousin Charles arrives one day for a visit, and Eugenie braves her father's 
anger to supply him with sugar for his coffee and a wax instead of a tallow candle. 
Charles has been brought up in wealth, but his father now loses all and commits 
suicide. Eugenie's pity for her unhappy cousin turns to love, which he seems to 
reciprocate. Engaged to marry her, with her savings he goes to the West Indies. 
The years wear on drearily to her, and she does not hear from him. Her mother 
dies, and she is an heiress, but is persuaded by her father to make over her property

complete ignorance of the New England temperament. To one of the cousins, 
Gertrude Wentworth, the advent of Felix Young, with his foreign nonchalance, is the 
hour of a great deliverance from the insufferable boredom of her suburban home. 
To marry Young, she rejects the husband her father has chosen for her, Mr. Brand, 
a Unitarian clergyman, who consoles himself with her conscientious sister Charlotte. 
The novel is written in the author's clean, precise manner, and bears about it a

published in 1847. Like Goethe's 'Hermann und Dorothea' it is an idyllic tale, in 
hexameters, of two lovers who are involved in the disasters of a time of war. When 
the Acadians are expelled from their homes in Grand Pr6 in 1755 for lending aid to 
the agitators against English rule, a betrothal has just been celebrated between 
Gabriel Lajeunesse and Evangeline Bellefontaine, son and daughter of the two 
wealthiest peasants of the village. In the confusion of embarkation the lovers sail on 
different ships and fail to rejoin one another. Gabriel, and his father, Basil, make 
their way down the Mississippi to Louisiana, where they again become prosperous 
by raising cattle. Evangeline, whose father has died of grief on the shore of Grand 
Pre*, journeys to New England, vainly looking for Gabriel. Refusing all offers of 
marriage she continues to seek him, under the protection of the parish priest, Father 
Felician. After many inquiries they arrive at Basil's ranch, only to find that Gabriel 
has just quitted it for the western prairies, and that they have unwittingly passed 
him on their way down the Mississippi. Evangeline now follows him across the 
prairies to the Ozark Mountains, but again misses him. She now remains for several 
months at the Jesuit Mission, awaiting Gabriel's expected return, and when he does 
not come follows him to the woods of Michigan and finds his camp deserted. After 
years of fruitless wandering, during which she becomes a faded and prematurely old 
woman, she comes to Philadelphia, where, as a sister of mercy, she cares for the poor 
and sick. At length, during an epidemic, she finds her long-lost lover, Gabriel, 
dying in the alms-house, and the lovers are united at his last breath. Both are 
buried in the Catholic cemetery. Though Longfellow had seen none of the places 
mentioned in the poem except Philadelphia he drew his information from excellent 
historical sources (among them Haliburton's 'Historical and Statistical Account of 
Nova Scotia/ 1829, Fremont's 'Expedition to the Rocky Mountains,' 1845, and Wm. 
Darby's 'Geographical Description of the State of Louisiana' (1816), and has made 
the poem an imperishable gallery of American scenery. Without complexity, the 
poem is a genuine and affecting record of human suffering relieved by human resolution and devotion. It is a charming idyll, and its hexameters, though criticized as 
too dactylic, have strength and movement.</summary>
  <summary author="Evelyn, John (1620-1706)" title="The Diary of John Evelyn" print_title="The Diary\nof\nJohn Evelyn">EVELYN, JOHN, DIARY (1818-19). The best-known of the books by which Evelyn 
is remembered is not a diary in the strict sense of the term, but a record apparently 
copied by the writer from memoranda made at the time of the occurrences noted in 
it, with occasional alterations and additions made in the course of transcription. 
The quarto volume in which it is contained consists of seven hundred pages clearly 
written by Evelyn in a small close hand, the continuous records of sixty-five years 
(1641-1706) crowded with remarkable events, the great plague and great fire, the 
Civil War, the Commonwealth, the Protectorate, the Revolution of 1688. But it 
contains also the impressions of a cultivated, traveled, and thoughtful man, who 
made frequent tours on the continent of Europe, and had access to all who were 
prominent in the Church, in literature, art, and science both at home and abroad. 
No other man who lived through those breathless days knew intimately so many 
grades and classes of his fellow-countrymen, or had so much right to speak on subjects that are still of living interest to thoughtful people. The book is an invaluable 
chronicle of contemporary events from the standpoint of one who was strongly 
attached to monarchy and personally devoted to Charles II. and James II., but 
opposed to their arbitrary measures. The writer is a devout adherent of the Church 
of England, yet shows a tolerance, remarkable in his day, for Catholics and others 
who were outside that communion. He has none of Pepys's love of gossip and 
triviality, insatiable curiosity, nor frankness of self-revelation. But besides the high 
affairs with which the diary mostly deals the reader will find many quaint and interesting details. At Haarlem "they showed us a cottage, where they told us, dwelt 
a woman who had been married to her twenty-fifth husband, and being now a widow, 
was prohibited to marry in future: yet it could not be proved that she had ever made 
away with any of her husbands, though" (the chronicler gravely adds) "the suspicion 
had brought her divers times to trouble." At Lincoln he "saw a tall woman six 
foot two inches high, comely, middle aged and well-proportioned, who kept a very 
neat and clean ale-house, and got most by people's coming to see her on account of 
her height."</summary>
  <summary author="Moore, George (1852-1933)" title="Evelyn Innes" print_title="Evelyn Innes">EVELYN INNESS; a novel by George Moore (1898). The daughter of an organist 
and a great singer, Evelyn has a beautiful voice, and dreams of studying music in 
Paris, but is likely to be sacrificed to her father's hobby, the music of Palestrina and 
the revival of Hturgic chants in church music. Sir Owen Asher, a wealthy amateur, 
interested in the father's theories of music, hears Evelyn sing at her father's concerts 
and is at once attracted by her voice and beauty. He wants to take her away from 
the drudgery of music lessons and it gratifies his vanity to discover a prima donna. 
Tempted by her ambition and in love with Sir Owen, she consents to go to Paris 
with him in order to have the best musical training. She tells her father of her purpose, and while he is conventionally shocked, he is enough of a musical genius himself 
to understand and appreciate her temptation. Sir Owen provides an English lady 
of title for chaperon, in order that the external conventions may be observed, and 
Evelyn enters an enchanted world of pleasure and success. Six years later she returns 
to England to appear in Wagnerian opera. Sir Owen adores her, and she intends to 
marry him when she leaves the stage, though with her, love has changed to affection. 
She becomes interested in a young Irish mystic and composer, a friend of her father's, 
and takes him as her lover, though she cannot bring herself to break with Sir Owen, 
Always a Catholic, she comes under the influence of a priest who arouses her conscience and spiritual nature, and induces her to give up both men, and make a retreat 
in a convent. The conflict between the spirit and the flesh, and the Churca and the
world is the occasion for an absorbing analysis of an artistic temperament. Early 
music, the art of Wagner, and its expression of the emotions, mysticism and convent 
life are successive interests, but the setting is pre-eminently musical. A sequel 
'Sifter Theresa' (1901) tells about Evelyn's spiritual trials as postulant, novice, and 
nun, and is a detailed description of convent life.</summary>
  <summary author="Jonson, Ben" title="Every Man in His Humour" print_title="Every Man\nin His Humour">EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR, by Ben Jonson (1598), one of the earliest and 
happiest of the author's efforts, is the first important comedy of character (as distinguished from comedy of incident) produced on the English stage. The aim of the 
author, as announced in the Prologue, was to depart from the license of romantic 
comedy, mixed with tragedy and history, and to adhere to comedy proper, "to sport 
with human follies not with crimes." By "humour" he meant peculiarities of conduct, and he has grouped together a number of characters with strongly marked 
personalities which stand out in contrast with each other. The most famous of these 
is Captain Bobadil, the military braggart, who has a place of his own on the English 
stage, a part which Charles Dickens, one of the most successful of amateur actors, 
filled to admiration. Kitely, a jealous usurer, whose house is the rendezvous of 
riotous young gallants, and who places a spy over his wife to warn him of any approach 
to unfaithfulness, is another skilfully contrived figure. Stephen the county-gull, 
Matthew the town-gull, and Cob the water-carrier help to complete the picture of 
London life. The female characters are correctly drawn, but do not occupy a very 
prominent part on the stage.</summary>
  <summary author="Burnett, Frances Hodgson (1849-1924)" title="A Fair Barbarian" print_title="A Fair Barbarian">FAIR BARBARIAN, A, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, appeared in 1881. Like 
James's 'Daisy Miller,' it is a study of the American girl in foreign surroundings. 
Miss Octavia Bassett, of Nevada, aged nineteen, arrives with six trunks full of finery, 
to visit her aunt, Miss Belinda Bassett, in the English village of Slowbridge. The 
beautiful American soon sets tongues wagging. All the village young ladies wear 
gowns of one pattern obsolete elsewhere, and chill propriety reigns. Octavia's 
diamonds and Paris gowns, her self-possession and frank independence, are frowned 
upon by the horrified mammas, especially when all the young men gather eagerly 
about her. Octavia, serenely indifferent to the impression she creates at the tea-drinkings and croquet parties, refuses to be awed even by the autocrat of the place, 
Lady Theobald. Her ladyship's meek granddaughter is spurred by admiration of 
the American to unprecedented independence. She has been selected to be Captain 
Barold's wife, but as he does not care for her, she ventures to accept Mr. Burmistone, 
upon whom her grandmother frowns. Barold meantime is enslaved by the charming 
Octavia. But he disapproves of her unconventional ways, and considering it a condescension on his part to ally himself with so obscure a family, he proposes with 
great reluctance and is astonished to meet a point-blank refusal. In due time, Octavia's father and her handsome Western lover join her; and after a wedding the like 
of which had never been witnessed at Slowbridge, she says good-by to her English 
friends. The story is slight, but the character-sketches are amusing, the contrast of 
national traits striking, and the whole book very entertaining.</summary>

years. It is a historical romance of the conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards, its 
scene laid upon Aztec soil, in the early part of the sixteenth century. The title is 
derived from Quetzalcoatl, "the fair god," the Aztec deity of the air. Descriptions 
of the religion and national customs are pleasantly interwoven with the plot. The 
Emperor Montezuma is drawn as a noble but vacillating prince, whom the efforts of 
nobles and people alike fail to arouse to* -a determined opposition to the invading 
Cortez. At first thinking that the Spaniards are gods, he insists upon welcoming 
them as guests, ignoring the protests of his^ubjects, and even permitting himself 
to be craftily shut up, a voluntary prisoner, in ^fte quarters of the Spaniards. Guatamozin, nephew and son-in-law to Montezuma, mighty in arms as wise in counsel, 
organizes the Aztecs for the overthrow of the Spaniards. A fierce conflict rages for 
many days. Toward its close the melancholy Montezuma appears upon the prison 
wall. Before all the people Guatamozin sends a shaft home to the breast of his 
monarch, who lives long enough to intrust the empire to his slayer, and also free him 
from blame for his death, explaining that the shaft had been aimed at his (Montezuma's) own request. The Aztec army now rallies, and the Spaniards, yielding at 
length to starvation, disease, and superior numbers, leave the empire. Too shattered 
to regain its former vigor, even under the wise rule of Guatamozin, the State gradually totters to its eventual fall, a catastrophe which the author indicates but does not 
picture. </summary>

thoroughly Scotch. The time is the reign of the weak but well-meaning King Robert 
III. of Scotland, whose scapegrace son David, the crown prince, is the connecting 
link in the story between the nobility and the burgher-folk of the city of Perth. 
Catharine, the beautiful daughter of Simon Glover, an honest burgher, is admired 
-by the crown prince, who seeks her love but not her hand. Repulsed in his suit, the 
prince, through Sir John Ramorny, his servant, tries to abduct Catharine on the eve 
of St. Valentine's day; but by the timely intervention of Henry Wynd, the armorer, 
she is saved; and Henry becomes, according to custom, her valentine for the year to 
come. Then follows a series of complications, political, ecclesiastical, and social, 
through which the eager reader follows the fate of the fair Catharine, the prince, 
the Black Douglas, and the other chief characters. Like all Scott's novels, 'The 
Fair Maid of Perth' contains fine descriptions of scenery, and stirring accounts of 
battle; and unlike many of his plots, this one allows the "course of true love" to ruu 
comparatively smooth, there being only obstacles enough to prove the mettle of the 
honest armorer.</summary>
  <summary author="Whitney, A. D. T. (Adeline Dutton Train) (1824-1906)" title="Faith Gartney's Girlhood" print_title="Faith Gartney's Girlhood">FAITH GARTNEY'S GIRLHOOD, by Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney (1863), is a story for 
girls, containing a record of their thought and life between the ages of fourteen and 
twenty. In " Sortes, " at a New- Year's party, Faith, who is a New England maiden, 
draws this oracle. 

    "Rouse to some high and holy work of love, 
    And thou an angel's happiness shalt know." 

The story tells how she fulfilled this condition, and what was her reward. Her 
haps and mishaps, her trials and tribulations, her sorrows and her joys (including
two lovers who may be placed in either category, as the reader pleases), are duly 
recorded, together with the experiences of her immediate circle. The story is 
brightly told, and the desirable element of fun is not wanting. It is a good Sunday-school book, if Sunday-school books are meant to influence the behavior of the secular 
six days. </summary>
  <summary author="Stevenson, Robert Louis (1850-1894)" title="Familiar Studies of Men and Books" print_title="Familiar Studies\nof Men and Books">FAMILIAR STUDIES OF MEN AND BOOKS, by Robert Louis Stevenson (1882), 
is a collection of essays, remarkable for a certain youthful originality and freshness 
in the expression of opinion. "In truth," the author writes, "these are but the 
readings of a literary vagrant. One book led to another, one study to another. The 
first was published with trepidation. Since no bones were broken, the second was 
launched with greater confidence. So, by insensible degrees, a young man of our 
generation acquires in his own eyes a kind of roving judicial commission through the 
ages; . . . sets himself up to right the wrongs of universal history and criticism." 

This he does with his usual charm and gentleness, but not without exercising 
sturdy criticism, even at the risk of running full tilt against conventional opinion. 
In the essay on Thoreau he boldly intimates that the plain-living, high-thinking 
code of life, of which the Walden recluse was an embodiment, may lead a man 
dangerously near to the borderland of priggishness. He challenges Walt Whitman's 
relations with the Muse of Poetry as illicit, but does full justice to the honest brain 
and the sweet heart back of the lumbering verse. For Villon, poet and scamp, he 
has no praise and little patience, the scamp outweighing the poet. 

The other essays treat, luminously and with much power of suggestion, of Victor 
Hugo's romances, of Robert Burns, of Yoshida-Tora Jiro, of Charles of Orleans, of 
Samuel Pepys, and of John Knox. The men he tries by the touchstone of his own 
manliness, the poets by the happy spirit of romance that was his. The book is 
altogether readable and pleasant. </summary>
  <summary author="Churchill, Winston (1871-1947)" title="A Far Country" print_title="A Far Country">FAR COUNTRY, A, by Winston Churchill (1913), is the story of a man who wanders 
far from the ideals of his youth. Hugh Paret, the son of an upright country lawyer, 
has such perseverance and such a keen eye for the legal loophole that he becomes a 
successful corporation lawyer while he is still a young man. He marries Maude 
Hutchinson and they settle down in a comfortable little house. For a while they are 
happy. Then, Paret 's income grows, and he wants to live more pretentiously, but 
his wife insists on modest living, for the children's sake. Paret, who begins to think 
that Maude is over-domestic, becomes attracted to Nancy Durrett, the wife of a 
millionaire. He realizes that it is Nancy whom he ought to have married; for she 
loves spending money and admires the cleverness of sharp-dealing. When Maude 
hears of the intimacy between her husband and Mrs. Durrett, she takes the children 
away from the atmosphere of money-getting and shallow living and goes to Europe 
with them. Hugh is shocked, but he continues his visits to Mrs. Durrett, whose 
husband's illness brings her to a realization of her duty. She sends Paret away and 
he throws himself into politics, and accepts the nomination for Governor. Working 
against him is Hermann Krebs, a self-made man who had worked his way through 
Harvard while Paret was lounging through. Anxious to hear one of his opponent's 
speeches, Paret goes to one of the Krebs meetings and as he listens, he feels himself 
in the presence of something bigger than his mercenary ideals. Krebs rouses his 
secret envy. In the middle of the meeting, Krebs is taken ill, and is removed to a
hospital where Paret visits him. There Krebs puts into words the idea which runs 
through the book: "In order to arrive at salvation, most of us have to take our 
journey into a far country; we have to leave what seem the safe things; we have to 
wander and suffer in order to realize that the only safety lies in development." 
Gradually it dawns upon Paret that his whole life has been a journey afar: in striving 
for money he has overlooked straight-dealing, and has warped laws to suit the needs 
of capital; in his search for fame and wealth, he has found only the husks of things. 
After relinquishing his practice he sails for Europe to be with his family. </summary>
  <summary author="Hardy, Thomas (1840-1928)" title="Far from the Madding Crowd" print_title="Far from the Madding Crowd">FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, a pastoral novel by Thomas Hardy (1874), 
is perhaps the best example of his earlier manner, and of his achievements in the 
domain of comedy. The story is mainly concerned with the love affairs of Bathsheba 
Everdene, a country girl with enough cleverness in her composition to render her 
impatient of the rustic Darby-and-Joan conception of marriage. Her first wooer, 
honest Farmer Oak, promises her all the insignia of married rank if she will accept 
him. She is pleased with the prospect of possessing a piano, and a "ten-pound gig 
for market"; but when Oak adds, "and at home by the fire, whenever you look up, 
there I shall be, and whenever I look up, there will be you, " the intolerable ennui 
of married life instantly weighs upon her imagination. She throws Oak over for a 
possible lover of more worldly pretensions. Only through an unfortunate marriage 
with a certain dashing Sergeant Troy does she learn to appreciate her first suitor's 
sterling worth. He for his part proves his devotion to her by serving her faithfully 
as her farm bailiff, after a change in her fortunes has placed her apparently out of his 
reach. 'Far from the Madding Crowd ' is exceedingly rich in humor, in descriptions 
of rustic scenes, and of rustic character. The day laborers who gather at the malt-house to pass around the huge mug called "The God-Forgive-Me" ("probably 
because its size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself") these clowns 
are hardly surpassed in Shakespeare for their natural humor, their rustic talk, or 
their shrewd observation. Not less remarkable are certain rustic pictures, as that 
of the lambing on a windy St. Thomas's night, the starlight and the light from Oak's 
lantern making a picture worthy of Rembrandt. The novel takes rank as a classic 
in pastoral fiction.</summary>

his health becoming impaired, he is summarily retired on a pension, to his astonishment and chagrin. During his first leisure hours he accidentally becomes acquainted 
with Poppy St. John, an actress, whose warmheartedness and unconventional ways 
strongly attract him. Dominic has a friend named George Loveland, whose spinster

year after Faraday's death. The volume is not a "life" in the ordinary sense, but 
rather a calm estimate of the scientist's work, with incidental views of the spirit in 
which it was done, and introducing such personal traits as serve to complete the 
picture of the philosopher, if inadequate fully to present the idea of the man. The 
study, which reveals the author as at once a graceful writer and an accomplished 
savant, is approached from the point of view of an intimate coadjutor and friend. 
In Faraday's notable career, his achievements in magnetism and electricity arc 
presented as being among the most remarkable; while his connection with the Royal 
Institution proved distinguished no less for the discoveries which he there made than 
for his lucid discussions of scientific questions. Of his own relation to Faraday, 
Tyndall says, with modesty, beauty, and feeling: "It was my wish to play the part 
of Schiller to this Goethe." And again: " You might not credit me were I to tell 
you how lightly I value the honor of being Faraday's successor compared with the 
honor of having been Faraday's friend. His friendship was energy and inspiration;

  <summary author="Turgenev, Ivan Sergeevich (1818-1883)" title="Fathers and Sons" print_title="Fathers and Sons">FATHERS AND SOWS, a novel by Ivan S. Turgenev, appeared first in 1861 
in the Russian Messenger, a Moscow review. As the name implies, it is an 
embodiment in fiction of the conflicting old and new forces at work in modern 
society; forces peculiarly active and noticeable in Russia, where iron-bound authority exists side by side with intellectual license. This novel brought into 
general use the term "nihilist" applied by the author to the chief character 
of the story, Bazarof, a young man of iconoclastic temperament, whose code of 
life was rebellion against all authority. His short, vivid career is depicted with 
remarkable strength and realism. Another "son" is his friend Arcadi Kirsanof, at 
whose paternal estate he is a guest. Kirsanof's father and uncle, representing the 
older generation, are brought into sharp contact and contrast with Bazarof. It is 
difficult to determine whether "fathers" or "sons" suffer most in the delineation of 
their peculiarities. The novel divided reading Russia into two camps, those who 
sided with the "fathers," and those who sided with the "sons." The government 
seized on the word "nihilist" as a designation of political reproach, a sense in which 
it has ever since been employed. With its terrible sincerity, its atmosphere of menacing calm presaging a storm, the book remains one of the most noted in the category 
of Russian fiction. </summary>
  <summary author="Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von (1749-1832)" title="Faust" print_title="Faust">FAUST, a dramatic poem in two parts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, is literally 
the work of a lifetime. The poem was projected and partly written in the stormy 
youthful years between 1773 and 1775. (A copy of the earliest portions has been 
preserved, usually referred to as the 'Urfaust'.) 'Faust, A Fragment' appeared in 
1790; 'Faust, The First Part of the Tragedy' in 1808; and the Second Part was 
completed in 1831, the year before the poet's death. Goethe takes the theme of the 
Renaissance scholar who sold himself to the Devil in his eagerness to win the knowledge which is power; but instead of condemning him to a remorseful death followed 
by damnation as the reactionary authors of the tale had done, Goethe, the spokesman 
of a new Renaissance, represents the scholar's bold aspiration as laudable and destined in spite of error and disaster to lead him ultimately to happiness and peace 
with God and his fellowmen. After a beautiful dedication and a playful bit of self-criticism in the form of a prelude on the stage in which the stage-manager, the poet, 
and the clown discuss the coming entertainment, the drama begins, in the fashion 
of a mediaeval mystery-play, with a prologue in Heaven. The archangels' hymn of 
the glories of creation is interrupted by Mephistopheles, the cynical spirit of negation, 
who ridicules the lofty aims and low performances of man, the crown of the world, and 
offers to wager that he can lure God's servant Faust into utter baseness. The 
Almighty gives him free permission to tempt Faust but prophesies that although 
Faust will fall he will ultimately attain a clearer vision and truer service, to which, 
indeed, strife and error are a necessary process. Faust is now depicted as a famous 
scholar and scientist, discontented with all that books and learning have brought him 
and longing for intellectual certainty and emotional release. He seeks inspiration 
by means of magical books but shrinks back in terror from the vision of the infinite, 
inscrutable mystery of the universe which they reveal to him. In despair he is 
about to kill himself when a surviving religious impulse, aroused by the Easter bells, 
restrains him. Next day he finds further alleviation in mingling with people who are 
enjoying the spring-festival. But the mood of human sympathy and faith is interrupted by Mephistopheles, who enters Faust's study in the form of a black poodle, 
suddenly changing to the appearance of a traveling scholar. He fills Faust's mind 
once again with dissatisfaction, and endeavors to entice him by promise of sensual 
delights to give up his soul in exchange, for the devil's assistance. Faust, who has 
desperately renounced faith and hope, has no belief that Mephistopheles can please 
him but is ready to make a bargain that if the devil can make him perfectly contented for one moment he, Faust, will forfeit his soul. The bargain made and 
sealed in Faust's blood they prepare to go out and see the world first the little 
world of desire and passion and then the great world of affairs. Faust is to test the 
pleasures of the senses and affections (Part I.) and then the pleasures of power exercised in public business and of art (Part II.). After Mephistopheles, disguised as 
Faust, has given some ironical advice to an incoming student, the pair see something 
of drink and debauchery at Auerbach's wine-cellar. Faust is disgusted, but Mephistopheles takes him to the Witches' Kitchen where he shows him in a magic mirror a 
female form of ideal beauty and gives him a love-potion which renews his youth. 
Soon afterwards Faust meets an innocent young girl, Margaret (Gretchen), on her 
way from church, is captivated by her beauty, and offers himself as her escort. Her 
refusal only stimulates his interest and he demands that Mephistopheles procure her 
as his love. They go unseen to her room, where the devil leaves a casket of jewels 
and Faust's passion through the atmosphere of sweetness and purity is ennobled and 
idealized. Later, however, Mephistopheles by a little flattery contrives to arrange a 
meeting between them at the house of a foolish neighbor. Faust is torn between a 
high ideal devotion and the cynical promptings of his companion; Gretchen falls 
deeply and devotedly in love with Faust but has an instinctive dislike of Mephistopheles. The lovers meet clandestinely and she gives herself to him. After some 
months her brother Valentine, returning from the wars, finds that she is about to 
become a mother. He makes an attack on Faust, who, through Mephistopheles's 
incitation, kills Valentine and hastily leaves the city. Distracted by her lover's 
departure, her brother's death, and that of her mother, through an overdose of the 
sleeping-draught which Faust had provided to facilitate their meetings, Margaret 
goes mad, drowns her child, and is condemned to be beheaded. Meanwhile Faust 
has been taken by Mephistopheles to the Witches' Sabbath on the Brocken where in 
wild pleasures he forgets his unfortunate love until recalled by a phantasm of Margaret 
with the thin red line of the headsman's axe about her neck. He insists that Mephistopheles rescue her at once; and they hasten on spectral chargers through the air 
past the place of execution to the prison, which they reach at midnight a few hours 
before Margaret is to suffer. She is in a demented condition, but recognizes Faust, 
and in a poignant scene recalls their past happiness and guilt. Seeing Mephistopheles, however, she refuses to be rescued and prays to Heaven for forgiveness. 
As Mephistopheles and Faust hurry away, she dies; and the sneer of the former 
"She is judged" is answered by a voice from above "She is saved." 

In the Second Part Faust is introduced to the great world, to the outer world of 
public affairs and the inner world of aesthetic beauty in classic and romantic art. 
After an opening scene in which Faust is purged from the effects of former suffering 
by the healing influences of a delightful landscape he is conducted by Mephistopheles to the court of the Emperor, whom they entertain with marvelous pageantry 
and whose realms they save from bankruptcy by persuading the people of the existence of buried treasure. At the request of the Emperor, Faust then conjures up as 
a spectacle the phantoms of Paris and Helen of Troy; but becoming enamored of the 
ideal beauty of Helen he attempts to seize her, and the vision disappears. In the 
quest for a union with this ideal beauty, Faust and Mephistopheles are conducted 
by the Homunculus, a tiny being whom Wagner, Faust's old pupil, has manufactured 
in his laboratory, to the fields of Pharsalia. Here, in the scene called the Classical 
Walpurgis-Night because it corresponds to the romantic diablerie of the Brocken 
scene in Part One, the various figures of Greek mythology, beautiful and ugly, appear 
before the northern pilgrims. The general meaning is that Faust is approaching 
ideal beauty through the appreciation of classic art; and his quest is attained in 
Act III. an act modeled on the Greek drama when Helen comes to life before 
the palace of Menelaus in Sparta as though just brought back from Troy, and is 
rescued from her husband's 'vengeance by Faust and Mephistopheles, who bear her 
to a mediaeval castle guarded by a troop of Gothic warriors. Here she is wooed and 
won by Faust; and they have a child, Euphorion, who represents the spirit of poetry 
that results from the union of the classic and the romantic. At length he soars into 
the air, and falls to the ground, his body vanishes and his soul ascends in light. Helen 
too disappears, but union with her has left Faust ennobled. He now desires to subdue 
nature to the service of man. An insurrection which he and Mephistopheles are 
able to quell for the Emperor in Act IV. puts them in possession of a great stretch of 
half-submerged seacoast, which Faust determines to reclaim and make the abode of 
a contented people. At the beginning of Act V. Faust, now in extreme old age, has 
nearly completed his task. His realm now supports a great population; but there 
still remains a noisome marsh to be reclaimed; and there is a little cottage which its 
owners, Philemon and Baucis, will not sell. He orders Mephistopheles to dispossess 
them and is punished by the infliction of blindness. Nevertheless he gives directions for the clearing of the marsh. As he contemplates this final work he realizes 
that neither in the satisfaction of passion, in intellectual development, nor in the 
cultivation of art does happiness exist, but in the unselfish service of others; and with 
this realization he declares himself perfectly contented and dies. Thus he apparently loses the wager made with Mephistopheles, who immediately summons the 
demons to carry off Faust's soul. But the happiness which Faust has attained is 
one which was beyond Mephistopheles 's power to grant and the nobility of which 
releases Faust from the bargain. Through error and suffering, experience and 
aspiration he has attained to a true service of God; and the angels transport his soul 
to Heaven amid a triumphant chorus of angels, saints, and pardoned sinners (Margaret included), while they worship the Divine Love as revealed in the Virgin Mother 
"das Ewigweibliche." 

In cosmic range, multiformity of symbolism, integration of diverse ideas, systems, 
and types of character in dramatic insight, flexibility of style and versification, 
architectonic faculty, and wise interpretation of life Faust stands alone in the literature of its century. It touches every sphere of life and sums up all the tendencies of 
the age which succeeded the French Revolution. </summary>

of New York between October 27, 1787, and April 2, 1788, and were published in 
book form in the latter year. There are eighty-five essays in the collection, of which 
eight were previously unpublished. Though the essays were signed ' Publius ' they 
were the work of three men. Alexander Hamilton wrote probably fifty-one of them, 
James Madison twenty-nine, and John Jay five. Their purpose in writing was to 
recommend to the people of New York State the adoption of the Federal Constitution drawn up by the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. The 
essays both in newspaper and book form circulated widely, became the most authoritative and influential defense of the new Constitution, and had an important share 
in bringing about its acceptance by the State of New York. In a perspicuous and 
rational manner, without appeals to passion and prejudice but by the force of logic 
and sound principles, the authors point out the weaknesses of the old Confederation, 
show the necessity of a centralized government as a check to war from without and 
disorder within, explain in detail the functions of each division of the government 
under the new scheme, and rebut the accusation that the centralization of the Constitution will tend to arbitrariness and autocracy. As an exposition as well as a 
defense of the Constitution by men who were intimately acquainted with its intention the book has permanent value, particularly for students of Constitutional Law, 
and it is taken into account by the courts in their interpretations.</summary>
  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="Felix Holt, the Radical" print_title="Felix Holt,\nthe Radical">FELIX HOLT, THE RADICAL, by George Eliot (1866). As a picture of upper 
middle-class and industrial English Hfe of the period of the Reform Bill agitation, this 
book is unsurpassed. If the critics who set George Eliot highest as a delineator of 
character find the story clogged with moralities, and hindered by its machinery, the 
critics who value her most for her pictures of life and nature rank 'Felix Holt' among 
her best achievements. It is bright in tone, it shows little of the underlying melancholy of George Eliot's nature, and its humor is rich and pervading. Its hero, Felix 
Holt, is a young workman whose capacity might attain anything, if his overpowering
conscience would let him conform to the ways of a comfort-loving world. But he is as 
much compelled by his dsemon as Socrates. He throws away his chances, comes near 
to shipwrecking his happiness, and accepts his unpleasant position as a matter of 
course. Contrasted with roughness and noble intolerance, which are his most 
obtrusive characteristics, is the charming daintiness of the exquisite Esther Lyon, 
whom he loves, and who dreads above all things to be made ridiculous, till a sight 
grander than many women ever see a man absolutely honest with man and God 
stirs the depths of her moral nature. The character of Harold Transome, the fine 
gentleman of the book, is struck out by the same strong hand that drew Grandcourt 
in 'Daniel Deronda,' a handsome, clever, frank, good-natured egoist. The minor 
characters stand out distinct and vivid. The covetous upstart, Jermyn; Esther's 
father, the rusty old Puritan preacher; Mrs. Transome, well-born, high-bred, splendid 
in her sumptuous, fading, anxious beauty, and carrying her tragical secret in a hand 
that scarcely trembles, but that may be made to drop the fragile thing by a rude 
touch; the shadowy squire, her husband; Mrs. Holt, the eulogist of the priceless 
infallible pills; Denner, the butler's hardheaded and faithful wife; the white-faced 
human monkey, Job; the aristocratic Debarrys; gipsy-eyed and irrepressible Harry; 
the sporting and port-drinking parson, John Lingon, not half a bad fellow, with his 
doctrine, "If the mob can't be turned back, a man of family must try to head the 
mob," they all live and move. "One group succeeds another, and not a single 
figure appears in any of them, though it be ever so far in the background, which 
is not perfectly drawn and perfectly colored."</summary>

who captivates "Him utterly. Stephen is under a cloud as he has just been dropped 
from his club on account of an escapade in which he had taken part while in an intoxicated condition; Sylvia, however, overlooks his failings, and although engaged 
to another man, feels strongly drawn towards Siward. Sylvia's engagement to 
Howard Quarrier, who is a very rich man, is not an affair of the heart as she has

she loves him but cannot marry him, as it is necessary to her happiness to have great 
riches. She tells him, however, that he has a fighting chance to win her and to go

the author's favorite detective, M. Lecoq, appeared in 1867. The scene is laid in 
the Paris of the day; and the title indicates the case file number in the records of the 
detective bureau. 

The story opens with the public details of a daring robbery which has been committed in the banking-house of M. Fauvel. Suspicion points to Prosper Bertomy, 
the head cashier. The deep mysteries of the case are fathomed by Fanferlot, a 
shrewd detective, and Lecoq, his superior in both skill and position. Lecoq figures 
as a French Sherlock Holmes, though his methods are essentially different. He is 
pictured as possessing surpassing insight, intelligence, and patient determination; 
employing the most impenetrable disguises for the pursuit of his inquiries. 

The denouement, gradually unfolded toward the close of the story, shows Prosper to have been the innocent victim of a plot. Madame Fauvel has had, before her 
marriage to the banker, an illegitimate son by the Marquis de Clameran, an arrant 
rogue who poses throughout as the benefactor of the Fauvels. De Clameran has 
caused Raoul de Lagors to personate this son (who is really dead). Raoul is introduced in Fauvel 's home as Madame's nephew, though she believes him to be her 
son. 

After frightening her into revealing the secrets of the bank-safe, Raoul commits 
the robbery. Her lips are sealed by her fear that her early life will become known to 
her husband. De Clameran plays upon these fears to force Madame Fauvel to 
induce Madeleine, her niece, to marry him. Madeleine consents in order to save her 
aunt, though she is really in love with Prosper. 

The plot is at last discovered; Raoul escapes, De Clameran becomes insane, 
Madame Fauvel is forgiven, and Prosper marries Madeleine. </summary>

of the author's experiences, fighting and serving the Dervishes, from 1879 to 1895. 
Slatin Pasha held the rank of colonel in the Egyptian army, and also occupied
the post of governor and military commandant in Darfur. Having been compelled 
to surrender to the Mahdi's vastly superior numbers, he remained a prisoner of that 
remarkable leader (of whose career an admirable account is given), and of the Mahdi's 
successor, the Khalifa Abdullahi, for more than ten years. Thus the Pasha was 
forced to join the Khalifa's bodyguard, and was constituted his trusted, though 
unwilling, adviser. This relation afforded him almost unmatched opportunities for 
obtaining an inside view of the "rise, progress, and decline of that great religious 
movement which wrenched the country from its conquerors, and dragged it back into 
an almost indescribable condition of religious and moral decadence." Valuable 
information is given regarding those military operations which occupied European diplomacy and arms for two decades; the siege and fall of Khartum, and the 
fate of "Chinese" Gordon, being of particular interest. The narrative is vigorous and 
full of detail, although the writer was not permitted to keep even a diary. At length, 
wearying of the dangerous favors of the Khalifa, Slatin Pasha made a dangerous 
escape, and rejoined his family in his native city of Vienna.</summary>

Cardross. Hamil immediately falls victim to the charms of Shiela Cardross, an unusually beautiful and fascinating girl, who is an adopted daughter of the financier. 
When he proposes she tells him that it is impossible to accept him as she is already 
married. Shiela then explains that two years prior to this time, when she was 
eighteen years of age, she made the discovery that she was not the real child of her 
beloved parents but had been a nameless foundling. Her anguish was such that she 
was almost beside herself and in a hasty moment she had married a young college 
friend of her brother's, who had offered her his name in this time of stress. He 
returned at once to college and she had hardly seen him since the event, which she 
had kept a secret from everyone. Realizing her terrible mistake and regretting her 
hasty act, she confesses her love for Hamil, but tells him she can never be his. Hamil, 
who sees the injustice of the situation to all concerned, begs her to get a divorce, but 
she tells him she will never do that as she will not bring disgrace on the kind parents 
who have done everything for her. Meanwhile, her husband, Louis Malcourt, has 
become interested in a wealthy society girl, named Virginia Suydam, and being an 
attractive, irresponsible young fellow has also an affair with a pretty actress named 
Dolly Wilming. Nevertheless, he is willing to acknowledge his marriage whenever 
Shiela wishes it, and finally, in a burst of remorse, she decides to do so. The result 
is disastrous for all concerned as Shiela treats Malcourt with utter coldness and is wife 
only in name, while Hamil and Miss Suydam are heart-broken. In a short time

describes the romantic experiences of an English girl, May Wedderburn, while she is 
studying music in Germany. Although the plot is somewhat conventional, a certain 
freshness or enthusiasm in the composition of the book endows it with vitality. The 
heroine leaves home to avoid marriage with a Sir Peter Le Marchant. She is enabled 
to do this through an elderly neighbor, Miss Hallam, whose sister had been the first
wife of Sir Peter, and had been cruelly treated by him. As Miss Hallam's companion, 
May goes to Elberthal on the Rhine near Cologne, one of those little German towns 
given up to music. On the journey thither, Miss Wedderburn is separated by accident 
from her traveling companions. A good-looking stranger comes to her assistance. 
He proves to be Eugen Courvoisier, first violin in the orchestra, a man about whom is 
the fascination of mystery. Taking offense at a supposed discourtesy of the beautiful 
young English girl whom he had protected, he refuses to recognize her. She, for her 
part, is already in love with him. By the kindness of Miss Hallam, she remains in 
Elberthal to have her voice cultivated, and her lessons in music and in love go on 
until the happy ending of the story. Her love is put to the touch by the supposed 
dishonor of Courvoisier, but bears the test without failing. 'The First Violin' 
abounds in dramatic descriptions of musical life in a small Rhine city, and makes the 
reader pleasantly at home in middle-class German households, where he learns to 
respect, if he does not admire, middle-class German respectability and calm content. 
If the book has the sentimentality of youth, its romance is altogether innocent and

tongues. It is an early work, written in his first flush of power, and is a characteristic 
story of Norwegian life among the common people. Several of the poems in the novel 
express fervently the author's optimistic patriotism. The early part of the tale is 
laid in a fishing village on the coast, where lives the fisher maiden, a strong-natured, 
handsome, imaginative girl, whose mother keeps a sailors' inn. Her development is 
traced in her love affairs, by which she gains a bad reputation, so that her mother 
sends her away from her native place; in her experience in Bergen, with its self-revelation of her own artist-nature by her first sight of a play; in her life in the family 
of a priest, with its chance for cultivation and training of her dramatic powers; and 
in the final adoption of the stage as a profession: the novel closing, rather tantalizingly, 
just as the curtain rises on her debut. Petra, the fisher maiden, has the instincts, 
gifts, and ambitions of the artist, and her earlier love episodes are but ebullitions of 
this chief motor-power. She is portrayed sympathetically; for as Bjornson stated to 
a friend, she is, in many of her traits, an embodiment of himself. The story is full of 
accurate yet charmingly idealized studies of native types and scenes, and is regarded 
as among the novelist's freshest, finest creations. </summary>

Paris during the autumn and winter of 1585-86, when political events made all 
France excited and immoral. The vexations of Henri III. and the ambitions of the 
queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, are vividly set before the reader, so as to hold 
his unflagging attention. "The Forty-five" are guardsmen led by the brave and 
noble soldier Crillon. The story opens on the morning of October 26th, 1585, with 
a description of a vast assembly of people before the closed gates of Paris, clamoring 
for admission, to witness the execution of Salcede, a convict murderer. This miscreant is no vulgar assassin, but a captain of good birth, even distantly related to the 
queen. King Henri III., his queen, Anne, and the queen mother, Catherine de' 
Medici, have come to witness the execution of the sentence, which is drawing and 
quartering. Word reaches the King that Salcede, on promise of pardon, will reveal 
important State secrets. Henri agrees to the condition, and receives a document 
which, to his disappointment, exonerates the Guises from the charge of conspiracy. 
The perfidious King orders the execution to take place, and a horrible spectacle 
ensues. After this dramatic opening incidents and events crowd thick and fast; and 
the two volumes are taken up with the unraveling of the political plots suggested in 
the first chapter. The story is one of the most famous of historical romances.</summary>

notes are given upon governmental policies, international complications, and the 
affairs with the many Indian peoples; while religious, educational, commercial, and 
sanitary matters are treated with sufficient fullness. Lord Roberts came into close 
touch with all the leading minds who shaped Indian affairs during the previous half-century, and perhaps the most valuable pages of his book are those which describe 
these great men.</summary>

he would prove himself a coward in any great emergency, and, knowing he was 
destined for the army, this thought has cast a shadow over his youth. 

He becomes engaged to a beautiful Irish girl named Ethne Eustace and announces 
the fact at a bachelor dinner given by him to his old friend Jack Durrance and two 
officers of his regiment, Captain Trench and Lieutenant Willoughby. While the 
dinner is in progress a telegram is brought to Feversham from Castleton, a brother 
officer, informing him that their regiment has been ordered into action and telling 
him to notify Trench. He destroys the dispatch without explaining the contents, 
tells his friends that on account of his approaching marriage he is going to resign 
from the army, and sends in his papers that night. His action is soon discovered by 
Trench and Willoughby and they unite with Castleton in sending him a box containing three white feathers with their cards enclosed. Feversham receives the box while 
dancing with his fiancee at a ball given at her house the following evening and when 
she calls for an explanation he tells her the story unsparingly. Ethne, who is a high-minded girl, is horrified at his avowal and, after telling him that all is over between 
them, breaks a white feather from her fan and adds it to the other three. Feversham, 
overwhelmed with misery, informs his father of his disgrace, then seeks his old friend 
Lieutenant Sutch, a past admirer of his dead mother, and tells him of his purpose 
to leave the country for the seat of war, and not return until he has redeemed each 
feather by some act of bravery. 

Durrance, who has never known of Feversham 's trouble, returns to England to 
find Ethne in reduced circumstances and still unmarried. Having always loved Her, 
he presses his suit, when he finds he can do so without disloyalty to his friend, but 
she refuses him and he returns to the Soudan. There he is suddenly stricken with 
blindness and Ethne upon hearing this writes that she will marry him. While 
engaged to Durrance, Willoughby brings to her the first white feather which Feversham has redeemed at the risk of his life, and this is followed some time later by the 
return of Trench with his, his rescue from prison having been accomplished by 
Feversham after frightful sufferings and privation. After six years of penance

desperate efforts to get sent up to the workhouse for winter lodging, as his more 
fortunate fellow-citizens would make arrangements for Palm Beach and the Riviera. 
He breaks a window, steals an umbrella, assumes the r61e of "maslier," tries drunk 
and disorderly conduct, but all in vain, the police refuse to arrest him. As, however, 
he lingers near a church listening to the anthem, resolved to lead a better life, a 
policeman arrests him for loitering. 'An Unfinished Story* is a stern arraignment 
of the employer who underpays his shop-girls. Dulcie is saved from going out with 
the man known as "Piggie" this one night by the look of "sorrowful reproach," in 
the eyes of General Kitchener looking down at her from his gilt frame on her dresser, 
but the end of the story will be later, "sometime when Piggie asks Dulcie again to
dine with him, and she is feeling lonelier than usual, and General Kitchener happens 
to be looking the other way." 'The Furnished Room' is really a ghost story. 
The ghost is a whiff of mignonette which suggests his lost sweetheart to the boy who 
by pathetic coincidence has come to the same "furnished room" where she had just 
ended her life. He is convinced that she has been in the room, and hopes to find 
trace of her, but the landlady will not tell the story of her last lodger, for fear of not 
renting the room. With loss of hope he loses faith, puts out the light, and turns on 
the gas, as she had done before him. 'The Sisters of the Golden Circle' are two brides 
who recognize their sisterhood on the top of a "rubber-neck wagon." The more 
fortunate sister allows her own husband to be arrested as a burglar long enough to 
let the real "Pinky" escape to finish his honeymoon. The humor, pathos, and 
philosophy of O. Henry are at their best in these varied sketches with characteristic 
surprise endings.</summary>
  <summary author="Sabatier, Paul (1858-1928)" title="Life of St. Francis of Assisi" print_title="Life of\nSt. Francis of Assisi">FRANCIS OF ASSISI, LIFE OF SAINT, by Paul Sabatier, was published in French 
in 1894 and translated by Louise Seymour Houghton in the same year. The author is 
a French Protestant theologian of the liberal school, but has an intense admiration 
for the character and teaching of St. Francis and believes in the reality of his inspiration and even in the actuality of such mystical experiences as the receiving of the 
stigmata, though he would not call such phenomena miraculous. Sabatier has made 
long sojourns at Assisi, has saturated himself with the literature and thought of the 
period at which St. Francis lived, and has here presented in a remarkably sympathetic 
spirit a picture of that time and of the man who exemplified its noblest tendencies. 
The work has that combination of scholarly exactitude in the use of historical information and imaginative recreation of a past age of faith that seems typical of the 
French rationalist school and is exemplified particularly by Renan.</summary>

  <summary author="Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft (1797-1851)" title="Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus" print_title="Frankenstein;\nOr,\nThe Modern Prometheus">FRANKENSTEIN; or, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS, by Mary Wollstonecraft 
Shelley (daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and wife of the poet Shelley), 
was published in 1817, and many subsequent editions have appeared. It is a sombre 
psychological romance, and has a morbid power which makes it one of the most 
remarkable books of its kind in English. The story begins with some letters written 
by Robert Walton, on a voyage to the North Pole, to a sister in England. He tells 
of falling in with a mysterious and attractive stranger, who has been rescued from 
peril in the Northern Seas, and over whose life appears to hang some mysterious 
cloud. This stranger, Frankenstein, tells to Walton the story of his life. He is a 
Genevese by birth, and from childhood has taken interest in natural science and the 
occult mysteries of psychology. The reading of such writers as Paracelsus and 
Albertus Magnus has fostered this tendency. He has a dear adopted sister, Elizabeth 
and a close friend, Henry Clerval. At the age of seventeen he becomes a student at 
the University of Ingolstadt, and plunges into the investigation of the unusual 
branches which attract him. Gradually he conceives the idea of creating by mechanical means a living being, who, independent of the ills of the flesh, shall be immortal. 
Like Prometheus of old, he hopes to bring down a vital spark from heaven to animate 
the human frame. After a long series of laboratory experiments, in which he sees 
himself gradually approaching his goal, he succeeds. But his creation turns out to be 
not a blessing but a curse. He has made a soulless monster, who will implacably 
pursue Frankenstein, and all his loved ones to the dire end. It is in vain that the 
unhappy scientist flees from land to land, and from sea -to sea. The fiend he has 
brought into existence is ever on his track, and is the evil genius of his whole family. 
He murders Clerval, brings Elizabeth to an untimely end, and so preys upon the fears 
and terrors of Frankenstein that the latter at last succumbs to despair. The wretched 
man accompanies Walton on his northern expedition, hoping that he may throw his 
pursuer off the scent; but finally, in an ice-bound sea, worn out by his hideous experiences, he dies, and over his dead body hovers the horrid shape of the man-machine. The monster then leaps over the ship's side, and disappears in the ice and 
mist. The story is one of unrelieved gloom, but both in its invention and conduct 
exhibits unquestioned genius. It is unique in English fiction. </summary>
  <summary author="Franklin, Benjamin (1706-1790)" title="The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin" print_title="The Autobiography\nof\nBenjamin Franklin">FRANKLIN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY, a narrative of Franklin's life from 1706 to 1757 
written partly in England in 1771, partly in France in 1784, and partly in Philadelphia in 1788-1789. A French translation of the first part appeared in 1791, an 
altered and incomplete version edited by Franklin's grandson in 1817, and an accurate edition of the entire work by John Bigelow in 1867. In clear limpid English 
Franklin tells of his birth and upbringing as the youngest son of a large family in 
Boston, of his apprenticeship to his brother, a printer, of his running away from home 
and successful entrance into the printing business at Philadelphia when only seventeen 
years of age; of Ms journey to England and experiences there as a journeyman 
printer; of his return to Philadelphia, acquirement of the 'Pennsylvania Gazette' 
(1729), his marriage (1730), his literary and journalistic successes; of his promotion 
of civic welfare by the establishment of an efficient police, a fire brigade, a philosophic 
club, a university and other social organizations; of his growing participation in 
public affairs, as clerk of the General Assembly, Postmaster of Philadelphia, and 
agent for Pennsylvania in negotiations with the British government (1757). Various 
personal anecdotes scattered among the records of his public activities illustrate his 
good sense, shrewdness, humor, and rationalistic views of life. His frank confession 
of his foibles and wrong-doing which he calmly dismisses as errata is typical of the 
"age of reason" as are his statements of religious belief and his methods of self-improvement. His helpfulness to his fellow-men both individually and socially is 
also in accordance with eighteenth-century ideas of practical goodness. The autobiography presents an able man without external advantages succeeding by force of 
clear thinking, geniality, thrift, and industry; its pictures of Franklin and his acquaintances are vivid, often humorous, and always entertaining.</summary>
  <summary author="Galsworthy, John (1867-1933)" title="Fraternity" print_title="Fraternity">FRATERNITY, by John Galsworthy (1909). Sylvanus Stone, Professor of Natural 
Science, an old man of eccentric habits and somewhat vague philanthropic aspirations, when his mind begins to fail, has given up teaching and come to live with his 
daughter, Bianca, an artist married to Hilary Dallison. In their home he becomes 
absorbed in writing a beautiful, mad book called the Book of Brotherhood. This 
volume is to embody the great truth that all men are brothers that the rich, clever, 
and independent people of this world have a "shadow" somewhere, no less a part of 
them for being poverty-stricken, stupid, and weak. Professor Stone gives Bianca's 
model a job in copying sections of his book daily. The little model comes gladly, not 
because she cares for Professor Stone or understands anything about the book, but 
because she has conceived a dog-like devotion for Bianca's husband, Hilary. Hilary 
is kindly but at first but mildly interested. Inevitably, however, Bianca becomes 
jealous. Her suspicions are not quieted by the discovery that her quixotic husband 
has bought clothes for the little model. Through her sister, Cecilia, Bianca learns 
that Ivy Barton, the model, has ensnared one Hughs, the respectable husband of a 
hard-working seamstress. Cecilia persuades Hilary to secure lodgings for Ivy far 
away from the passionate Hughs, and to ask her to discontinue work on the Book of 
Brotherhood. Dumbly the little model obeys Hilary's orders and keeps away from 
the house. Unable to stand the interruption in his writing, Professor Stone falls ill. 
Realizing that the little model's presence is necessary to her father, Bianca seeks out 
the girl at her new lodgings. Ivy returns gratefully, only to reopen attack on the 
hitherto impassive Hilary. Finally, she kindles his passion, but in the end disgust 
at the thought of "going out of his class" keeps Hilary from the scandal of an elopement. We see this class feeling, in Cecilia, who finds herself physically unable to 
minister to Mrs. Hughs in the squalor of Hound Street; in her daughter Thyme, who 
can stand only one day of life in the slums; and in Cecilia's husband, Stephen, who 
makes no secret of the folly of "getting too close to those people." In contrast to all 
these is Sylvanus Stone. To him the world represents one great fraternity. But 
all the people in the book, from the little model to his granddaughter Thyme, 
regard his great ideal as harmless insanity, and the general impression of the book is 
one of subtle irony as to any real "fraternity" among people separated tc; their upbringing, tastes, position, and social environment.</summary>

Among Professor Saintsbury's works, which have been mostly on literature, few have
been more serviceable than this handbook. It covers a broad field, and one especially 
attractive to English readers, as well as not too accessible to them. Accurate in its 
statements of fact, short, simply and directly written, and yet comprehensive, it 
considers all departments of literature, including history, theology, philosophy, and 
science. It starts with origins, and ends with writers of the present day; treating 
respectively of 'Mediaeval Literature,' 'The Renaissance,' 'The Seventeenth Century,' 
'The Eighteenth Century,' 'The Nineteenth Century,' and offering a sufficient 
though necessarily brief description of the various men and works "whereof knowledge is desirable to enable the reader to perceive the main outlines of the course of 
French literature." In the interchapters, inserted at the ends of the books, are 
summed up the general phenomena of the periods as distinguished from particular 
accomplishment. </summary>

  <summary author="Aristophanes (-450--388)" title="The Frogs" print_title="The Frogs">FROGS, THE, a comedy by Aristophanes, acted at Athens, 405 B.C. Dionysus, 
the patron of the theatre, deploring the death of the great Athenian dramatists 
resolves to descend to the realm of Pluto to bring back Euripides. For this purpose 
he assumes the garb of Hercules, whose successful expedition to that region is well-known. Accompanied by his slave, Xanthias, he goes to Hercules for advice, and 
then proceeds to Charon's ferry, to be transported to Hades. In these scenes 
Dionysus appears as an amusing but cowardly braggart who pretends great heroism 
but manifests the utmost silliness and imbecility. The slave, Xanthias is the usual 
low-comic servant and Hercules treats them both with good-humored contempt. 
During the passage of the Stygian march, Dionysus, whom Charon forces to row, is 
greeted by a chorus of frogs whose raucous refrain, "Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax," 
derisively welcomes him to the lower regions. Arrived at his destination Dionysus, 
with the utmost poltroonery, trembles with fright at every noise. He attempts to 
assume the r61e of Hercules but on the first threats of the porter, AEacus, he persuades Xanthias to change clothes with him and take his place. This plan, however, 
he quickly reverses when a feast and agreeable company are promised to the visitor 
by an attendant of Proserpine. Further omens of trouble, however, induce him to 
make the exchange; and there follows a farcical scene in which the servant attempts 
to turn the expected tortures upon the master and the master upon the servant until 
u3acus solves the difficulty by flogging them both. It now develops that Euripides, 
the object of their mission, has just created an uproar in Hades by claiming precedence over Aeschylus as a dramatic poet. A public disputation between them has 
been ordained by Pluto, and Dionysus, as patron of the drama, is now appointed 
judge. The discussion that follows is marked by brilliant wit, apt allusion, and 
minute acquaintance with the works of both poets. Euripides, with many parodies 
of specific Aeschylean passages, arraigns the master of tragedy for pomposity, cumbrousness, and turgidity, and Aeschylus condemns Euripides as monotonous and 
mean in style, immoral in subject-matter, and corrupting in his influence. For an 
amusing extract from the debate see the LIBRARY under Aristophanes, pp. 786-787. 
Dionysus at length gives decision in favor of Aeschylus. In reward for his services 
he is teasted by Pluto and sent back to announce to the Athenians that Aeschylus 
will be allowed to revisit them. With the latter's prayer that Sophocles may hold 
his place during his absence the drama closes. In accordance with the usual practice 
of the old comedy a number of personal and political allusions are scattered through 
the work, referring especially to the proposed recall of Alcibiades.</summary>

1796-97. It is a strange combination of humor, tenderness, and fine imagination, 
purporting to be the record of the "married life, death, and wedding of the lawyer of 
the poor, Siebenkas." The dream-indulging, impractical ooet of a lawyer represents 
Jean Paul himself; while Siebenkas's wife. Lenette, the embodiment of the practical
in life, stands for Richter's good old mother. Her devotion to every-day ideas is 
well illustrated when "Siebenkas, " in the midst of a grandiloquent harangue upon 
eternity is interrupted by her exclaiming: "Don't forget to leave off your left 
stocking to-morrow morning: there is a hole in it! " Of all Jean Paul's more prominent characters, Siebenkas is one of the least extravagantly sentimental; and his 
history, though less ambitious than either "Titan" or "Hesperus, " is more popular. 
It displays Richter's kaleidoscopic variety of thought, wild figures of style, and 
bewildering leaps from the spiritual to the earthly and grotesque and thence again 
to ideal heights. In some passages the rapid sweep of thought seems too strong for 
coherent utterance, and again it calms down to a placid sweetness very ingenuous. 
His phrases, linked by hyphens, brackets, and dashes, almost defy the translator's 
art, and are sufficiently difficult for even the German scholar.</summary>
  <summary author="Harte, Bret (1836-1902)" title="Gabriel Conroy" print_title="Gabriel Conroy">GABRIEL CONROY, by Bret Harte (1876). In this, the longest of Bret Harte's 
novels, the scene is laid in California during the forties and fifties, and affords vivid 
pictures of life at a mining camp. The story opens in the California Sierras, where 
Captain Conroy's party of immigrants, lost in the snow, are dying of starvation and 
cold. Among them are Grace Conroy, the heroine; her brother and sister, Gabriel 
and "Oily"; Arthur Poinsett, an adventurous young fellow of high social standing, 
who is traveling under the name of Philip Ashley, and who has fallen in love with 
Grace; Dr. Devarges, a famous scientist, who, before he dies, bestows upon Grace 
the title to a silver mine which he has discovered; and Mr. Peter Dumphy, who spies 
upon the dying scientist, and afterwards tries to profit by his eavesdropping. A few 
of the party are rescued, among them Grace and Philip. Complications arising out 
of her inheritance, and other mining claims, afford an intricate and interesting plot, 
which a number of vividly conceived characters develop. So exciting and rapid is 
the action that the book would be classed among sensational novels, but for its 
artistic treatment and high literary quality. A great many personages are introduced, among them Dona Sepulvida, who is one of the author's best female characters. 
In this novel, as in most of Bret Harte's works, are vivid imagination, strong local 
color, dramatic dialogue, daring humor, and much keenness of perception; but most 
readers have preferred the author's short stories. </summary>
  <summary author="Voynich, E. L. (Ethel Lillian) (1864-1960)" title="The Gadfly" print_title="The Gadfly">GADFLY, THE, by E. L. Voynich (1898). This is a story of the revolutionary party 
in Italy, written with great power, and with extreme bitterness against the priesthood. The English hero, Arthur Burton, bred in Italy, is studying at the Catholic 
Seminary in Pisa, where the director, Montanelli, is his devoted friend. The sensitive and ardent Arthur is an orphan, who, unhappy in the family of a worldly uncle, 
has thrown himself into the plots of young Italy. He is betrayed by a priest, his 
confessor, to the Austrian police, and sent to prison with his comrades, who regard 
him as the traitor. On being released, he encounters a young English girl, Gemma 
Warren, whom he loves, and who taunts him with his treachery and strikes him on 
the cheek. The same night his uncle's wife, who hates him, makes the terrible 
revelation that although he is the reputed son of an English gentleman, his real father 
is a priest who has expiated the sin of his youth by exile as a missionary in China, and 
who is no other than his beloved teacher, Montanelli. In despair under these redoubled blows, Arthur fiees in disguise to South America. Thirteen years later, a 
club of revolutionists in Florence elects a new member to write its incendiary pamphlets. This member is a South American, called for his wit and power to sting, the 
Gadfly. Gemma, now the widow of a revolutionary leader, begins by detesting the
Gadfly for his vindictiveness, which is shown especially towards the good bishop 
Montanelli; but becomes interested in his cleverness and his underlying melancholy, 
and ends by loving him, without suspecting that he is the lost Arthur. They engage 
together in a dangerous insurrection in the Apennines, during which the Gadfly, in 
the disguise of a pilgrim, makes a pretended confession to the bishop, and overhears 
him in agonized prayer for his lost son. The Gadfly is taken prisoner at the moment 
when the bishop is striving to interpose between the combatants. Though treated 
with horrible cruelty in the Austrian prison, nothing can tame his fiery spirit. The 
bishop, who, while living a life of piety and good works, is a constant prey to remorse, 
intercedes with the governor for the unfortunate prisoner, who rewards him only by 
mockery and insults. Finally, in an interview in the Gadfly's cell, after he has been 
wounded in an attempt to escape, he reveals himself to the bishop, but refuses his 
love and intercessions on his behalf, except on condition that his father shall give 
up for him his allegiance to the hated church, and renounce the Crucified One. This 
the unhappy bishop cannot do; and the Gadfly, refusing on his side all concessions, 
is led out to be shot in the prison-yard. The wretched father becomes insane; and 
in a terrible scene at the altar during the high mass, pours forth his madness and 
despair, and falls dead of a broken heart.</summary>

simple. An old woman, Gammer Gurton, while mending the breeches of her servant 
Hodge, loses her needle. The loss of an article so valuable in those days not only 
worries her, but throws the whole household into confusion. Tib, her maid, and 
Cock, her servant boy, join in the search. Presently Diccon the Bedlam appears, 
a kind of wandering buffoon, who persuades Gammer Gurton that her gossip,' or 
friend, Dame Chat, has taken the needle. Out of this false accusation arise all kinds 
of complications, and the whole village shares in the excitement. Dame Chat, and 
her maid Doll, Master Baily and his servant Scapethrift, and Dr. Rat the curate are 
brought into the discussion. In the end, as Diccon is belaboring Hodge with his 
hand, the latter is made painfully aware of the fact that the needle has been left by 
Gammer Gurton sticking in the back of his breeches. Broad jokes, extravagant 
language, and situations depending for their fun on the discomfiture of one or another 
of the actors gave this play great popularity in its day. Readers of the present time

Lyons, Rabelais edited a series of almanacs, in which are found 'La Pantagrueline 
Pronostication' (The Forecastings of Pantagruel), and 'Les Chroniques Gargantines' 
(The Chronicles of Gargantua), under the immediate title of 'Pantagruel, roi des 
Dipsodes, restitue en son naturel, avec ses faits et prouesses espouvantables; composes 
pour M. Alcofribas, abstracteur de quintessence' (Pantagruel, king of the Drunkards, 
portrayed according to life, with his amazing deeds and feats of prowess; written by 
M. Alcofribas, distiller of the very quintessence). This forms the second book of the 
work as it now stands; for Rabelais, seeing the success of his efforts, revised his 
1 Chroniques Gargantines' and made of them the 'Vie tres horrifique du grand Gargantua, pere de Pantagruel' (The very horrible life of the great Gargantua, father of 
Pantagruel), which is now the first book. Then came the 'Tiers livre des faits et 
diets heroiques du bon Pantagruel' (Third book of the heroic sayings and doings of 
the good Pantagruel), to which Rabelais affixed his own name with the additions of 
"docteur en me'decine et calloier des isle d'Hieres" (physician and monk of the island 
of Hyeres). In 1552 appeared the fourth book. The fifth book (1564) is posthumous, and it is doubtful if Rabelais composed it. The five books form a sort of 
satirical epopee. The first book, which alone forms a complete whole, relates the 
birth, childhood, the journey to Paris, the education, and the farcical adventures 
of the giant Gargantua, son of Grandgosier; also the war which he waged against the 
invader Picrocole, the mighty deeds of his friend and ally Jean des Entommeurs, and 
the foundation of the abbv of The'leme. This book also is probably the best known 
and most prized, as illustrating the serious ideas of its author upon war, the education 
of children, and the organization of monastery life. The myth of Gargantua was of 
Celtic origin, dating from the time of the importation of the Arthurian legends into 
France by the troubadours of William the Conqueror.</summary>

  <summary author="Tarkington, Booth (1869-1946)" title="The Gentleman from Indiana" print_title="The Gentleman from Indiana">GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA, THE, by Booth Tarkington, was published in 
1899. It is the story of John Harklcss, a young college graduate, the most promising 
man in his class, who, instead of doing at once the great things expected of him, 
settles down in a dull little Indiana town and becomes proprietor and editor of a 
country newspaper. He attacks with both bravery and vigor the hosts of evil which 
prevail about him, and thereby wins for himself both friends and enemies. His 
personal efforts toward bringing to justice a number of White Caps, whose outrages 
have previously gone unpunished, single him out for their vengeance. With absurd 
indifference to danger, young Harkless goes about unarmed and pays slight attention 
to the stray bullets which cross his path. The climax of the story is reached when, in 
the midst of a scene with the girl he loves, he dashes off into the darkness and is set 
upon by a band of cut- throats. The only trace of him to be found the following day 
is a bloody stain near the railroad track and he is given up as dead. The people of the 
commanity, aroused from their lethargy by this last outrage, start out to devastate 
the neighboring settlement from which the White Caps come. News is received that  
Harkless is alive, the hamlet is spared, and the men who have taken part in the 
attempted murder receive the penalty of the law. The hero finally returns in triumph 
and marries the girl of his choice, who has run his paper with great success during his 
absence, and has been able by this means to get her lover nominated as a member to 
Congress. There are many stirring incidents in the story and they are narrated with 
much strength and vigor.</summary>
  <summary author="Virgil (-70--19)" title="The Georgics" print_title="The Georgics">GEORGICS, THE (Georgica), by Virgil. This great work, admittedly the masterpiece of didactic poetry, and considered by many superior to the ^Eneid in style, was 
begun, probably at the request of Msecenas, in 717, and completed in 724 A. U. C. 
It is divided into four books. The first treats of agriculture; the second of trees; 
the third of the raising of cattle; and the fourth of bees. Virgil has utilized the writings of all the authorities on agriculture and kindred subjects in the Greek and Roman 
world. Thus, besides the 'Coconornica' of Xenophon, the works of the Carthaginian 
Mago, translated by order of the Senate, and those of Cato and Varro, he consulted 
the 'Phenomena' of Aratos for the signs of the weather, those of Erastothenes for the 
celestial zones, the writings of Democritus for the revolution of the moon;' and so 
admirably are all his materials used with his own poetic inspiration, that precept and 
sentiment, imagination and reality, are merged in one complete and harmonious 
unity. No matter how exact or technical the nature of the teaching, it is never dry. 
An image introduced with apparent carelessness vivifies the coldest formula: he tells 
the plowman he must break up the clods of his field and harrow it again and again, 
and then at once shows him golden-haired Ceres, who looks down on him from the
Olympian heights with propitious eyes. Besides mythology, which the poet uses 
with great reserve, he finds in geography resources that quicken the reader's interest. 
Tmolus, India, the countries of the Sabseans and Chalybes, enable him to point out 
that every land, by a secret eternal law, has its own particular products; and to 
predict to the husbandman that if he follow good counsels, a harvest as bounteous as 
that which arouses the pride of Mysia or Gargarus shall reward his toil. The episodes 
and descriptions scattered through the poem are of surpassing beauty. Among them 
may be mentioned: the death of Caesar, with the prodigies that accompanied it, at 
the end of the first book; in the second, the praise of Italy, its climate and its flocks 
and herds; the pride and greatness of Clitumnus, with her numerous cities, her fine 
lakes, as broad and as terrible in their fury as seas, with her robust population and 
great men who gave to Rome the empire of the world; and, as a pendant to this sublime picture, the fresh, idyllic delineation of country life and the happiness of rustic 
swains, if they only knew (sua sic bona norint), then, at the end of the third book, the 
splendid games and the magnificent temple of white marble he proposes to raise to 
Augustus; the description of the pest that devastated the pasture-lands of Noricum, 
unrivaled for elegance and pathos; and the touching story of the love of Orpheus and 
Eurydice with which the poem concludes.</summary>
  <summary author="Tacitus, Cornelius (56-117)" title="Tacitus on Germany" print_title="Tacitus on Germany">GERMANY ('Germania') , by Tacitus. The full title of the work is 'De Origine, Situ , 
Moribus, ac Populis Germanise.' It was written probably in 99, and is a geographical 
and political description of ancient Germany, or at least of the part of it known to the 
Romans, which did not extend far beyond the Elbe. It may be divided into three 
parts: Chapters i.-v. describe the situation of the country, the origin of its population, 
and the nature of the soil; Chapters vi.-xxvii., the manners of the Germans in general 
and their method of waging war; and the remaining chapters deal with the several
tribes, and give a careful and precise account of the manners and customs that distinguish one from another. This fine work is at once a treatise on geography, a 
political study of the peoples most dreaded by Rome, a study of barbarous_manners, 
and, by the simple effect of contrast, a satire on Roman manners. It is not only the 
chief source of the ancient history of the tribes that were to form the northern and 
western nations of Europe, but it contains an account of the germs of almost every 
modern institution, military, judicial, and feudal. Notwithstanding occasional 
errors in geography and some misconceptions as to the religion of the Germans, the 
striking accuracy of his details, as well as the correctness and precision of his general 
views, have led some scholars to believe that Tacitus spent the four years of his life 
which are unaccounted for, from 89 to 93, in Germany. But this is only conjecture; 
and the means of information within his reach were as valuable as a personal visit 
to the country he describes might have been. Many of his friends, like Rufus, had 
made campaigns beyond the Rhine, and their knowledge was at his disposal. He must 
have consulted the numerous hostages and captives that were always in the city. 
Deserters, such as Marbod and Catuald, not to mention the merchants who trafficked 
with the Teutons, may also have helped him to give his work the character of truthfulness and the local color that distinguish it. He is supposed, in addition, to have 
derived great assistance from the 'History of the Wars in Germany,' in twenty books, 
by Pliny the Elder, a work now lost. Tacitus has been accused of a tendency to 
idealize the ancient Germans, in order to contrast their virtues with the vices of the 
Romans. But while he no doubt intends now and then to point a moral for the 
benefit of his countrymen, he is not blind to the faults of the people he describes, and 
has no love for them. He speaks of their bestial drunkenness, their gluttony, their 
indolence, and rejoices with a ferocious joy at the destruction of sixty thousand of the 
Brusteri, slain in sight of the Roman soldiers by their own countrymen. </summary>
  <summary author="Bernhardi, Friedrich von (1849-1930)" title="Germany and the Next War" print_title="Germany\nand\nthe Next War">GERMANY AND THE NEXT WAR ('Deutschland und der nachste Krieg') by 
General Friedrich von Bernhardi, published in 1911, translated into English in 1916, 
is an argument in favor of war in general and an aggressive German national policy 
of industrial and territorial acquisition backed up by military preparedness. The 
first two chapters defend war as an essential to healthy national life, as the fountain 
of social virtues and as the privilege and duty of the vigorous and expanding state, 
which can tolerate the control of no international sentiment or external control on 
earth. War is not inconsistent with Christian morality, which applies to the individual and not to the state. In the next two chapters the author traces rapidly 
the political and economic development of the German empire and the mission of the 
German people to promote scientific research and efficient government. The chapter 
headed by the famous title 'World Power or Downfall' demonstrates the isolation of 
Germany and Austria among the European powers, shows the motives for a coalition 
against them, and maintains that national disaster is the alternative to a vigorous and 
aggressive policy. The following chapter pleads for ample provision for war, which 
the socialist parties and pacifists are hindering by their constant opposition and 
propaganda. Then follow three chapters forecasting the probable course of such a 
world- war, both by land and sea, and discussing the means of victory. They contain 
some successful predictions and some that have been falsified by the event. Germany's strength as the head of a coalition of central powers fighting on interior lines, 
and the limitations of Prance and Russia are accurately predicted, and the general 
nature of England's naval campaign is outlined; but there is no anticipation of the 
possibility that England and her colonies might raise a great army or of the German
submarine campaign. The remainder of the book deals with army and navy organization, the need of a more practical and scientific education with additional 
military training, and the necessity of financial, economic, and political preparedness. 
The book is a valuable presentation of the popular German worship of the state as 
the highest authority in existence, with a morality transcending individual morality, 
and of the ruthless German application to international policy of the biological doctrine of the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest. </summary>
  <summary author="Ibsen, Henrik (1828-1906)" title="Ghosts" print_title="Ghosts">GHOSTS, a powerful play by Henrik Ibsen (1881), gives dramatic embodiment to 
the modern realization of heredity. Ibsen, treating this subject on its tragic side, 
considers the case of the darker passions as they are handed down from father to son. 
The fatalistic atmosphere of 'Ghosts' resembles that of a Greek drama. It is a 
Greek tragedy translated into the littleness and barrenness of modern life. 

Oswald Alving, the son of a dissipated, worthless father, has been brought up by 
his mother in ignorance of his dead parent's shame. Yet he has within him the seeds 
of a transmitted disease, the evil sown by a previous generation. He has gone 
into the world to make a name for himself, but he is forced to return to his mother's 
home. He drinks to excess, and he exhibits tendencies to other more dangerous 
vices. His wretched mother sees in him the ghost of his father; she sees the old 
hateful life clothed in the form of the boy she has reared so carefully. He himself feels 
the poison working in his veins. The play closes upon the first sign of his incipient 
madness. In this drama, the mother, Mrs. Alving, is the type of the new woman in 
revolt against the hideous lies of society, because she has suffered through them. 
She is learning to think for herself; to weigh social morality in the balances. Her 
adviser, Pastor Manders, has been called "the consummate flower of conventional 
morality." He is a type of the world's cautiousness and policy in matters ethical,
of that world's disposition to cover up or refuse to see the sins of society. He is of 
those who make of marriage a talisman to juggle away vice. 

'Ghosts' is perhaps the most remarkable of Ibsen's dramas in its searching 
judgment, its recognition of terrible fact, its logical following of the merciless logic of 
nature.</summary>

the administration of sectarian charitable associations. Ginx, a navvy, earning
twenty shillings a week, with a wife and twelve children living in two rooms of a 
crowded tenement in a squalid district of London, despairs of finding enough to feed 
another mouth, and declares he will drown the thirteenth when it arrives. He is 
swerved from his purpose by the offer of the "Sisters of Misery " to take charge of the 
infant, and Ginx's baby becomes an inmate of a Catholic Home. The child is "rescued" from this Home through the efforts of a Protestant society; this society, 
through dissensions and lack of funds, turns him over to the parish; parochial law 
requires his return to the parents: and Ginx finally leaves his baby, then grown to 
boyhood, on the steps of the Reform Club, and flies the country. Ginx's baby grows 
up a thief, and ends his life by jumping off Vauxhall bridge, at the spot where his 
father set out to drown him on the day of his birth. 'Ginx's Baby 1 was published 
anonymously in London in i87i,'speedily ran through many editions, was republishcd 
in the United States, and excited warm controversy in the press and even in Parliament. It was followed by satires on other phases of social economy, Mr. Jenkins 
preserving his anonymity for some time under the signature of "The Author of Ginx's 
Baby"; but none of the other works of this author attained such a vogue or exerted 
such an undoubted influence upon the direction of social reforms. </summary>
  <summary author="France, Anatole (1844-1924)" title="The Gods are Athirst" print_title="The Gods are Athirst">GODS ARE ATHIRST, THE ('Les Dieux ont Soif') by Anatole France (1912). A 
story of the French Revolution which pictures the extraordinary Paris of the Terror. 
The hero, a young artist, Evariste Gamelin, is a stern young idealist, a fanatical 
disciple of Robespierre, who is the dominating figure of the book. Evariste attends 
the nightly meetings of the Jacobin Club and absorbs the lofty abstractions and 
inquisitorial casuistry of his idol. He is made a member of the Revolutionary Tribune and becomes a veritable priest of the guillotine, ministering to the blood-thirsty 
gods. Marie Antoinette is tried and condemned before him and a procession of 
defeated generals, emigre's, and suspects are brought to the Tribunal from the overflowing prisons. His office gradually makes a monster of him, and he votes constantly for death. It is his sacred mission to destroy the enemies of France, and to 
be accused is to be condemned. Evariste loves Elodie, daughter of a wealthy dealer 
in prints and engravings, who also undertakes fraudulent contracts for the army. She 
is not a typical daughter of the Revolution, which she secretly abhors, but she is 
fascinated by her gloomy lover, though his ideas terrify her. He sends an innocent 
aristocrat to the guillotine because he believes him to be Elodie's former lover and 
betrayer. With the downfall of Robespierre, Evariste is condemned to the guillotine
to which he has sent countless others. He rides in the fatal cart, insulted by the 
same hostile crowd who so recently had jeered at the aristocrats. He dies without 
remorse, regretting only that he has betrayed the Republic by being "oversparing 
of blood." Elodie takes his best friend for her new lover in the last chapter. She 
throws the ring engraved with Marat's head which Evariste had given her into the 
fire, and makes her tryst with the new lover with the same password she had used 
for Evariste. Brotteau, a noble reduced to making jumping-jacks in an attic, but 
always a philosopher, is a contrast to the fanatical Evariste. He shares his room with 
an ex-monk, with whom he argues the existence of God. They are arrested, with a 
little girl from the street whom he has befriended, and he goes calmly to the guillotine 
reading his Lucretius to the last.</summary>
  <summary author="Apuleius" title="The Golden Ass" print_title="The Golden Ass">GOLDEN ASS, by Apuleius. A collection of stories divided into eleven books, 
and written in Carthage, not later than 197 A. D. It is usually described as an 
imitation of 'The Ass 1 of Lucian; the author himself tells us that it is a "tissue woven 
out of the tales of Miletus"; but probably both works are based on the same earlier 
originals. The plot is of the thinnest. A young man sees an old sorceress transform 
herself into a bird after drinking a philter. He wishes to undergo a similar metamorphosis, but mistakes the vial and is turned into an ass. To become a man again, 
he must eat a certain species of roses, and the pilgrimage of the donkey in search of 
them is the author's excuse for stringing together a number of romantic episodes and 
stories: stories of robbers, such as 'The Brigand for Love,' where a youth becomes a 
bandit to deliver his betrothed; 'The Three Brothers,' where the three sons of a 
wealthy peasant are massacred by a ferocious squire and his servants; and 'The 
Bear of Plataea,' where a heroic robber lets dogs devour him in the bearskin in which 
he has hidden himself. Then come ghost stories: 'The Spectre,' where the phantom 
of a girl penetrates in full noonday into a miller's yard, and carries off the miller to a 
room where he hangs himself; 'Telephron,' where a poor man falls asleep, and supposes himself to awaken dead; 'The Three Goat-Skins,' where the witch Pamphile 
inadvertently throws some goats' hair into her crucible, instead of the red hair of her 
fat Boeotian lover, thus bringing back to lif e in place of him the goats to whom the 
hairs belonged. But the prettiest and most finely chiseled of these tales are those 
that paint domestic life: 'The Sandals,' where a gallant devises a very ingenious 
stratagem to get out of an unpleasant predicament and regain possession of his 
sandals, forgotten one night at the house of a decurion; and several of the same kind. 
Many others are real dramas of village life. The most famous of all is 'The Loves 
of Psyche.' It occupies two entire books, and has inspired poets, painters, and 
sculptors, in all ages and countries; though perhaps the author would have been rather 
astonished to learn that the moderns had discovered in the sufferings of his heroine a 
profound metaphysical allegory, symbolizing the tortures of the soul in its pursuit of 
the ideal. Apuleius excels every other ancient writer in catching the changing aspects 
of nature and of human comedy; and with all his fantastic imaginative power, he is 
as realistic as Zola, and sometimes as offensive. He describes, for instance, the 
agony of a broken-down horse tortured by swarms of ants, with the same precision 
that he uses to relate the gayety of a rustic breakfast, or a battle between wolves and 
dogs. On the other hand, he puts in no claim to be a moralist, and is much more 
concerned about the exteriors of his characters than about their souls. </summary>
  <summary author="Frazer, James George (1854-1941)" title="The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion" print_title="The Golden Bough:\nA Study of Magic\nand Religion">GOLDEN BOUGH, THE, a Study in Magic and Religion, by J. G. Frazer (2 vols. 
1890. 3d ed. 12 vols. 191 1-15). The original edition was an epoch-making work 
in folk-lore. In its enlarged and completed form, the book is a treasury of primitive 
customs and beliefs, epitomizing the available information in eminently readable
form. The priest of Nemi is the central figure of the mystery of the mythology of 
vegetation, the death and resurrection of the corn and wine. In the sacred grove of 
Diana on the woodland lake of Nemi, the priest or king of the wood guarded the oak 
of the divinity. Servius, four hundred years after Virgil, commenting on the "golden 
bough" which admitted ^Eneas to the underworld, writes that the priest of Nemi 
must be a fugitive slave, that he must gain his office by slaying his predecessor, his 
divinity, by plucking a bough from the sacred tree in which the god is animate. The 
successor must in his turn be slain in full vigor of life to enact the mystery play by 
which the return of spring is not only illustrated but enforced. The rite cannot be 
explained by the ideas and beliefs of classical antiquity, and Dr. Frazer traces its 
origin to the customs of the primitive life it has survived. Religion always involves 
an appeal to a god, Dr. Frazer contends. Magic, opposed to religion, tries to control 
nature by would-be science based^on the association of ideas by similarity or contact. 
"Homeopathic magic commits the mistake of assuming that things which resemble 
each other are the same. Contagious magic commits the mistake of assuming that 
things which have once been in contact with each other are always in contact." The 
tales of primitive superstition with which he illustrates his theories of the origin of 
kings and priests are the entire ancient mythology, the worship of trees, sacred bonfires, taboo, initiation, ritual of the scapegoat, totems, etc. In concluding volumes 
the Norse god, Baldur the Beautiful, represents the pantheon of dying and reviving 
gods symbolic of the return of spring. The mistletoe growing on the oak is the 
"golden bough" over which Baldur like Diana's priest kept watch and ward. Volume 12 is a detailed subject index and bibliography.</summary>

marries Maggie Verver, the daughter of an American millionaire. The prince and 
princess, her father and her little son, the "principino," have an ideally happy life 
together in their English home, until the advent of Charlotte Stant, an American 
girl of brilliant social qualities, friend of Maggie's schooldays. Charlotte and the 
prince were once lovers and would have married but for their poverty. The prince 
has never told his wife of their intimacy. He considers Charlotte's visit a suitable 
time to retire with Maggie to Italy. Charlotte marries the millionaire, Mr. Verver, 
and is thus brought into permanent relations with the prince. An exquisite affection exists between Maggie and her father. With the American innocence and 
artlessness, which Mr. James has depicted often since the days of Daisy Miller, 
father and daughter give so many hours to each other that the other two meet 
constantly. Maggie gradually discovers the relations between her husband and 
her father's wife; instead of making a fuss she quietly gives herself to the task of 
shielding her father from the knowledge of it, and winning her husband's love, 
"which she vows must be as complete and perfect as the original crystal of the 
broken bowl" that property of the story which takes a unique part in the development 
of the plot. Her father had married Charlotte in devotion to his daughter, to free 
her from the thought that she had left him lonely. His love discovers what she tries 
to conceal, and he solves the situation by taking Charlotte back to America never to 
return. In the first half of the book we see the problem as reflected in the consciousness of the prince; in the second half, Maggie is the refracting medium for the 
author and reader. But for two minor characters, friends of the family, a Mrs. 
Assingham ajid her husband, and their knowledge and understanding, it would be 
difficult for the reader to follow the turn of affairs, since everyone is trying to conceal 
from everyone else knowledge of what is known. At the end of the story the princess
has already won her prince for her own in truly royal conquest of fineness of conduct 
and greatness of love.</summary>

been swept away during the war. The family estate, " Elphinestone," which has 
been owned by the Keiths for generations, has to be sold and passes into the hands of 
a rich New Yorker named Aaron Wickersham, whose son, a wicked and unprincipled 
young fellow, plays a prominent part in the story. Gordon, with the help of a 
friend, Norman Wentworth, the son of a rich New York banker, and some assistance 
from his neighbor, Squire Rawson, is enabled to go to college and acquires the education he has so much desired. He teaches a country school and while so doing meets 
a rich and beautiful city girl named Alice Yorke, who captures his heart. Her ambitious mother discourages his suit, but he vows that some day he will be rich and 
influential and with this goal in view works with tireless energy. Rich mining 
interests become located at "Elphinestone" and upon Squire Rawson's land, and 
Wickersham endeavors to secure the latter property, but is balked in his desire. 
Rawson puts Keith in control of his interests and in course of time he becomes a very 
rich man. His business takes him to the city and he again sees Alice Yorke, but 
before he has attained his success, she marries a rich and elderly man named Lancaster. 
He subsequently dies, leaving Alice a rich and fascinating widow and Keith is divided 
between the admiration he feels for her and the warm interest he feels in Lois 
Huntington, a charming young girl whom he has known from childhood. In the 
end he marries Lois after having repaired some of the wrongs that Wickersham 
has caused. </summary>

benefit of fellow-Christians similarly tempted Bunyan here sets forth with great 
plainness, vividness, and sincerity the spiritual experiences which preceded and 
accompanied his conversion. He relates his humble birth and poor education, his 
early dread of Hell, his subsequent carelessness about religion, and the wickedness 
(no doubt exaggerated by Bunyan) of his youthful life. Marriage with a serious-minded woman led him to attend church and respect the external forms of religion; 
a sermon on Sabbath-breaking and a woman's rebuke of his swearing induced him to 
give up these and other practices such as dancing and bell-ringing, to study the Bible, 
and to lead a moral life. He was now inclined to be self-satisfied; but through the 
instruction of some poor women of Bedford he came for the first time to a conviction 
of sin, the impossibility of salvation through his own righteousness, and the necessity 
of a new birth. These convictions were strengthened by the influence of John 
Gifford, a converted royalist officer, now a Baptist minister at Bedford. A long 
period followed in which Bunyan sought for assurance of salvation. Believing firmly 
that suggestions, both divine and diabolical might enter his mind in the form of 
recollected texts or wandering thoughts, he records minutely the alternations of hope 
and despair which exalted and dejected him by turns. Intellectual doubts assailed 
him. For about a year he was in morbid terror of committing the unpardonable sin. 
Later he was assailed by an irrational suggestion to blaspheme Christ by selling him. 
Convinced that he had committed this sin he was at length rescued from black 
despair by an intuition of pardon. Thus oscillating between fear and hope he at 
length found peace. The book is an absolutely sincere record of a genuine spiritual 
crisis in a nature of singular strength, emotional force, and religious insight.</summary>

Spanish town and its society, very picturesque in setting, but holding within it the 
tumult of passion and sin, was published in 1895. The scene is laid in quaint old 
Lancia (which is supposed to mean Oviedo), and reflects the life of thirty or forty 
years ago. The story opens with a bitter northeast wind and drenching rain; the 
clack of wooden shoes; the well-wrapped ladies (there were no carriages) struggling 
on toward the light and warmth of the palace of Quinones de Leon, the Grandee. 
The party has passed in; a man cowering beneath the storm creeps along the wall, 
reaches the palace, takes a bundle from under his cloak, places it near the door, and 
enters upon the gay scene. This is Luis Conde de Onis, who, engaged to Fernanda, 
has been enticed into an intrigue with Amalia, the young wife of the Grandee. It is 
their child that he has left at the door. The child is found when the guests are 
departing, and cared for by the old Grandee and his wife, the child's mother. Around 
these personages gathers a group of quaint characters: Don Christobal and his four 
marriageable daughters; the Senoritas de M6re, kindly old spinsters who always 
help forward the marriage projects of the young people; and Paco Gomez, the rough 
jester. Fernanda, at a rural fate, discovers the infidelity of her fiance, and madly 
throws herself away upon a boorish colonial planter, on whose death she returns to 
Lancia, and sets herself to win Luis from Amalia. The time of their wedding is at 
last announced; and Amalia, always reckless and desperate, revenges herself upon the 
helpless child of Luis, who has grown up a beautiful little girl, the pet of the household. 
With fiendish craft she tortures the child, under the plea of discipline. The gossips 
of the town have heard of what has been going on; and Luis, to save the child from 
her mother, promises Amalia to give up Fernanda. Luis appears at the house of 
Don Pedro, the Grandee, who although infirm, rises to attack him, and falls back 
dead. The father escapes with the little Josefina, and attempts to take her to his 
pwn home. The book closes in a pathetic scene, where the hapless child dies on the 
journey, in her father's arms.</summary>

the friendship of Honore* the younger with Frowenfeld, their falling in love with 
mother and daughter, and the course of their wooing. Other characters prominently 
connected with the story are the former domestic slave, Palmyre; Philosophe; Dr. 
Keene, a friend of Frowenfeld's; and Raoul Innerarity, the clerk of Frowenfeld and 
a typical young Creole. The final reconciliation of the hostile families and the 
marriage of the young people are brought about by the intervention of the fiery old 
Agricola. The book is of special interest in showing the attitude of the Creole 
population toward this country at the time of the cession of the Louisiana Purchase 
to the United States. Its character-study is close, and the sub-tropical atmosphere 
of place and people well indicated. It was Cable's first novel, being published in 
1880.</summary>
  <summary author="McCutcheon, George Barr (1866-1928)" title="Graustark" print_title="Graustark">GRATTSTARK, by George Barr McCutcheon, was published in 1901. It is entitled 
"the story of a love behind the throne" and is a thrilling tale of romance and adventure. The hero Grenfall Lorry, a rich and attractive young American, while 
traveling becomes acquainted with a charming foreigner who afterwards proves to 
be the Princess of Graustark visiting America incognito. The acquaintance is 
begun in a unique manner as Lorry and Miss Guggenslocker are accidentally left 
behind at a small way-station and only succeed in overtaking their train after a 
rough and perilous drive during which she clings to him for protection. This is the 
beginning of friendship which ripens into passionate love, and after the departure of 
the lovely foreigner from the country, Lorry finds life unendurable and starts in 
search of her. In his quest for Graustark he is joined by his friend Harry Anguish, 
whom he meets in Paris and who becomes the companion of his adventures. On the 
night of their arrival in Graustark they frustrate the plan of the wicked Prince 
Gabriel to kidnap the Princess, and while rescuing her, Lorry discovers to his astonishment that she is the object of his search. The Princess cannot accept Lorry's 
advances owing to her high position and also to the fact that she is about to consent 
to many a neighboring Prince named Lorenze, in order to save her country from 
financial ruin. On the day of the betrothal, however, Lorenze is found murdered, and 
Lorry who has had an altercation with him is accused of the crime. Lorry is saved 
from the vengeance of the murdered man's father through the intervention of the 
Princess, who declares her love for him, and the real assassin, Gabriel, the rival 
Prince, is convicted by the cleverness of Anguish. Lorry, who has become a popular 
hero, is allowed to marry the Princess in spite of his lack of royal blood, and Harry 
Anguish marries the Countess Dagmar, the Princess's lady-in-waiting, which brings 
the story to a happy conclusion.</summary>
  <summary author="Dickens, Charles (1812-1870)" title="Great Expectations" print_title="Great Expectations">GREAT EXPECTATIONS, Dickens's tenth novel, was published in 1861, nine years 
before his death. As in ' David Copperfield,' the hero tells his own story from boyhood. Yet in several essential points 'Great Expectations' is markedly different 
from ' David Copperfield,' and from Dickens's other novels. Owing to the simplicity 
of the plot, and to the small number of characters, it possesses greater unity of design. 
These characters, each drawn with marvelous distinctness of outline, are subordinated 
throughout to the central personage "Pip," whose great expectations form the pivot 
of the narrative. 

But the element that most clearly distinguishes this novel from the others is the 
subtle study of the development of character through the influence of environment 
and circumstance. In the career of Pip, a more careful and natural presentation of 
personality is made than is usual with Dickens. 

He is a village boy who longs to be a "gentleman. 1 ' His dreams of wealth and 
opportunity suddenly come true. He is supplied with money, and sent to London 
to be educated and to prepare for his new station in life. Later he discovers that his 
unknown benefactor is a convict to whom he had once rendered a service. The 
convict, returning against the law to England, is recaptured and dies in prison, his 
fortune being forfeited to the Crown. Pip's great expectations vanish into thin air. 

The changes in Pip's character under these varying fortunes are most skillfully 
depicted. He presents himself first as a small boy in the house of his dearly loved 
brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, the village blacksmith; having no greater ambition 
than to be Joe's apprentice. After a visit to the house of a Miss Havisham, the 
nature of his aspirations is completely changed. Miss Havisham is one of the 
strangest of Dickens's creations. Jilted by her lover on her wedding night, she 
resolves to wear her bridal gown as long as she lives, and to keep her house, as it was 
when the blow fell upon her. The candles are always burning, the moldering banquet 
is always spread. In the midst of this desolation she is bringing up a beautiful little 
girl, Estella, as an instrument of revenge, teaching the child to use beauty and her 
grace to torture men, Estella's first victim is Pip. She laughs at his rustic appearance, makes him dissatisfied with Joe and the life at the forge. When he finds himself 
heir to a fortune, it is the thought of Estella's scorn that keeps him from returning 
Joe's honest and faithful love. As a " gentleman ' ' he plays tricks with his conscience, 
seeking always to excuse his false pride and flimsy ideals of position. The convict's 
return, and the consequent revelation of the identity of his benefactor, humbles Pip. 
He realizes at last the dignity of labor, and the worth of noble character. He gains a 
new and manly serenity after years of hard work. Estella's pride has also been 
humbled and her character purified by her experiences. The book closes upon their 
mutual love. 

"I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and as the morning 
mists had risen long ago, when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising 
now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw the 
shadow of no parting from her." 

'Great Expectations' is a delightful novel, rich in humor and free from fals.e 
pathos. The character of Joe Gargery, simple, tender, quaintly humorous, would 
alone give, imperishable value to the book. Scarcely less well-drawn are Pip's 
termagant sister, "Mrs. Joe"; the sweet and wholesome village girl, Biddy, who
becomes Joe's second wife; Uncle Pumblechook, obsequious or insolent as the person 
he addresses is rich or poor; Pip's friend and chum in London, the dear boy Herbert 
Pocket; the convict with his wistful love of Pip; bright, imperious Estella: these are 
of the immortals in fiction.</summary>
  <summary author="Crawford, F. Marion (Francis Marion) (1854-1909)" title="Greifenstein" print_title="Greifenstein">GREIFENSTEIN, by Francis Marion Crawford (1889). The duplicity of a woman 
who brings disgrace on a proud old family forms the mainspring of an exciting narrative, certain episodes of which are even startling. Baron von Greifenstein supposes 
himself to be legally married to Clara Kurtz. After twenty-five years, his half-brother Von Rieseneck, a disgraced and fugitive ex-officer, confesses that the woman 
is his wife, though he had long believed her dead. The realization that his dearly 
loved son Greif is nameless fills the baron with rage against Clara, who is hated not 
less by her lawful husband for her desertion of him. The two men, feeling themselves 
disgraced and degraded, write explanatory letters to their respective sons, kill the 
woman and then themselves. The news reaches Greif at his university, but his 
father's letter does not appear. His friend (in reality his half-brother) Rex, son of 
Rieseneck, learns all; but keeps the secret to himself, and goes with Greif to his home. 
Greif wishes to release his cousin, Hilda von Sigmundskron, from her betrothal vows 
to him; but she refuses to give him up, and finally he assumes the name of Sigmundskron and marries her. After a happy year the baron's letter turns up in an old coat, 
and Greif discovers the whole truth. He is plunged into the depths of despair but 
Hilda tears up the letter, thus destroying all evidence of the ugly secret, and by her 
love and devotion she finally brings him to a more cheerful state of mind. Meantime 
Rex discovers that he has fallen in love unwittingly with Hilda. In consequence he 
tries to shoot himself, but is prevented from doing so by Greif and Hilda, who have a 
deep affection for him, and who finally persuade him that life is still full of opportunity, and, in time, of happiness. The events of the story occur in Swabia; and the 
time is from 1888 onward. The incidental pictures of German university life, student 
duels, etc., will be found interesting.</summary>
  <summary author="Peacock, Thomas Love (1785-1866)" title="Gryll Grange" print_title="Gryll Grange">GRYLL GRANGE, by Thomas Love Peacock. The plot of this, as of all of Peacock's 
novels, is very simple. The heroine is Morgana Gryll, niece and heiress of Squire 
Gryll, who has persistently refused all offers of marriage, of which she has had many. 
The hero, Algernon Falconer, is a youth of fortune, who lives in a lonely tower in 
New Forest, attended by seven foster sisters, and with every intention of continuing 
his singular mode of life. Morgana and Algernon are brought together by the familiar device of an accident to the lady which compels her to spend several days at the 
tower. A sub-plot of equal simplicity is given in the love-affairs of Lord Curryfin 
and Alice Niphet. The most interesting character in the book is the Rev. Doctor 
Opimian, a lover of Greek and madeira, who serves as a mouthpiece for the author's 
reactionary views on modern inventions, reforms, education, and competitive 
examinations. The material side of his character is summed up in his own words, 
"Whatever happens in this world, never let it spoil your dinner." 'Gryll Grange' 
was Peacock's last novel, having been published in serial form in i860.</summary>
  <summary author="Holmes, Oliver Wendell (1809-1894)" title="The Guardian Angel" print_title="The Guardian Angel">GUARDIAN ANGEL, THE, by Oliver Wendell Holmes (1867). The author says in 
his preface: "I have attempted to show the successive evolution of some inherited 
qualities in the character of Myrtle Hazard." The story opens in 1859 in the New 
England village of Oxbow. Myrtle, a beautiful orphan of fifteen, born in tropical 
climes, descended from a line of ancestors of widely varying natures, lives with an 
austere and uncongenial aunt, who fails utterly to control her turbulent, glowing 
impulses. Disguised as a boy she runs away, is rescued from drowning by Clement 
Lindsay, a handsome young sculptor, and brought home by Professor Gridley. An 
illness follows which leaves her for a time hysterical, highly impressionable, prone to 
seeing visions, and taking strong fancies. Thanks to the watchful care of Professor 
Gridley (whom she afterward calls her "Guardian Angel ") she emerges safe from this 
state, and is sent to a city school to complete her education. Among her suitors is 
Murray Bradshaw, a lawyer possessed of the secret that under an old will she is likely 
to come into a large fortune. He plots to win her, but is balked by Professor Gridley; 
and she gives her love to Clement Lindsay, who joins the army and rises to the rank 
of Colonel. During the war she goes with him to the front, and "In the offices of 
mercy which she performed ... (in the hospital) . . . the dross of her nature 
seemed to be burned away. The conflict of mingled lives in her blood had ceased." 
Dr. Holmes's characteristic wit is shown in many of the shrewd sayings of the kindly 
old Professor and other characters, and his delightful enthusiasm makes the book 
more interesting than most more formally constructed novels.</summary>
  <summary author="Swift, Jonathan (1667-1745)" title="Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World" print_title="Gulliver's Travels\ninto Several Remote Nations\nof the World">GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, Jonathan Swift's most famous book, was published in 
1727. It is onu of the most brilliant and profound of satires, one of the most imaginative of stories, and one of the best models of style. 'Gulliver's Travels' was given
to the world anonymously; though a few of Swift's friends, including Pope, Gay, 
Bolingbroke, and Arbuthnot, were in the secret. It became immediately popular, 
and has never lost its interest for both young and old. 'Gulliver's Travels,' says 
Leslie Stephen, "belongs to a literary genus full of grotesque and anomalous forms. 
Its form is derived from some of the imaginary travels of which Lucian's 'True History' 
itself a burlesque of some early travelers' tales is the first example. But it has 
an affinity to such books as Bacon's 'Atlantis' and More's 'Utopia' and again to 
later philosophical romances like 'Candide' and 'Rasselas.'" It begins with Gulliver's account of himself and his setting forth upon the travels. A violent storm off 
Van Diemen's Land drives him, the one survivor, to Lilliput, where he is examined 
with curiosity by the tiny folk. They call him the "man-mountain," and make 
rules for his conduct. With equal curiosity he learns their arts of civilization 
and warfare. His next voyage is to Brobdingnag, where he is a Lilliputian in 
comparison to the size of the gigantic inhabitants of this strange land, in which he 
becomes a court toy. In Brobdingnag, Scott says Swift looked through the other 
end of the telescope, wishing to show the grossness of mankind as he had shown 
their pettiness.

The next adventure is a voyage to Laputa, where the inhabitants are absorbed in 
intellectual and scientific pursuits, and "taken up with intense speculations," and 
their conduct is most eccentric; this is probably a satire upon pedantry. Gulliver 
next visits Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, and Japan, and gives an account of the Struldbrugs, 
a famous tribe of men who have gained physical immortality without immortal youth, 
and find it an awful curse. The last voyage takes the traveler into the country of the 
Houyhnhnms, where the horses under this name have an ideal government, Swift's 
Utopia, and are immensely superior to the Yahoos, the embodiment of bestial 
mankind. The irony and satire may be understood when one remembers that Swift 
said: "Upon the great foundation of misanthropy the whole building of my travels is 
erected"; and the remark that the King of Brobdingnag made to Gulliver "The 
bulk of your natives appear to me to be the most pernicious race of little odious 
vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the face of the earth" may be 
accepted as the opinion of the cynic himself regarding mankind. Hazlitt said that 
in 'Gulliver's Travels' Swift took a view of human nature such as might be taken by 
a being of another sphere. His description of Brobdingnagian literature has been applied to the masterly prose of his great book: "Their style is clear, masculine, and 
smooth, but not florid; for they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary 
words, or using various expressions."</summary>
  <summary author="Lawrence, George A. (George Alfred) (1827-1876)" print_title="Guy Livingstone;\nor,\n'Thorough'" title="Guy Livingstone; or, 'Thorough'">GUY LIVINGSTONE, by George Alfred Lawrence. This novel, published in England in 1857, was the first of a class of stories which extol and glorify a hero endowed 
with great muscular strength and physical prowess; and while not representing any 
particular school of thought or feeling, it expressed an increasing demand for a literary 
model possessed of strength and sternness both of mind and body. Guy Livingstone 
is a young Englishman of wealth, who combines enormous physical strength with 
grimness and ferocity of disposition. His pugilistic prowess enables him to thrash 
prize-fighters and perform various remarkable exploits, which are admiringly chronicled by Livingstone's intimate friend Hammond, the raconteur of the story, who is 
entertained among other guests at the hero's ancestral hall, Kerton Manor in Northamptonshire. Here had dwelt Guy's ancestors, whose portraits were characterized 
by "the same expression of sternness and decision" as distinguished their powerful
descendant. In this circle of friends are Mr. Forrester, a dandified life-guardsman; 
Miss Raymond, with whom Forrester is in love; and Flora Bellasys, a voluptuous 
beauty. Mr. John Bruce, a Scotchman, is introduced, who is engaged to Miss 
Raymond, and who is made uncomfortable by the other guests on account of his lack 
of suitable enthusiasm for field sports. Forrester and Miss Raymond afterwards 
elope, aided by Livingstone, whose engagement to Miss Constance Brandon, a 
beautiful young woman of refined tastes, soon takes place. In a thoughtless moment 
the hero flirts with Flora, and is discovered by Constance kissing her rival in a conservatory. Constance at once casts Livingstone off, and then pines away and dies, 
after summoning her lover to her bedside, which he reaches in time for a last interview, in which she foretells his early death. He is stricken with brain fever, and 
during his convalescence is visited by Flora, whom he refuses either to see or to forgive. He emerges from his sick-room changed and softened in nature. He goes to 
Italy; where he tracks down Bruce, who has barbarously murdered his rival Forrester, 
and wrings from him a confession of guilt. Returning to Kerton, Livingstone gets a 
fatal fall from his enormous horse Axeine, who rolls on him and crushes his spine, 
He dies after some weeks of torture. The book enjoyed a wide popularity, and is the 
best known of the author's works.</summary>
  <summary author="Scott, Walter (1771-1832)" title="Guy Mannering" print_title="Guy Mannering">GUY MANNERING, by Sir Walter Scott. 'Guy Mannering,' the second of Scott's 
novels, appeared anonymously in 1815, seven months after 'Waverley.' It is said 
to have been the result of six weeks' work, and by some critics is thought to show the 
marks of haste. Its time is the middle of the eighteenth century, its scene chiefly 
Scotland. Guy Mannering himself is a young Englishman, at the opening of the 
story traveling through Scotland. Belated one night, he is hospitably received at 
New Place, the home of the Laird of Ellangowan. When the laird learns that the 
young man has studied astrology, he begs him to cast the horoscope of his son, born 
that very night. 

The young man, carrying out his promise, is dismayed to find two possible 
catastrophes overhanging the boy: one at his fifth, the other at his twenty-first year. 
He tells the father, however, what he has discovered, in order that he may have due 
warning; and later proceeds on his way. 

The fortunes of the Laird of Ellangowan, Godfrey Bertram, are now on the ebb, 
and he has hardly money to keep up the estate. His troubles are increased when his 
son Harry, at the age of five, is spirited away. No one can learn whether the child is 
dead or alive, and the shock at once kills Mrs. Bertram. After some years the 
father himself dies, leaving his penniless daughter Lucy to the care of Dominie 
Sampson, an old teacher and a devoted friend of the family. When things are at their 
worst for Lucy Bertram, Guy Mannering, returning to England after many years' 
military service in India, hears accidentally of the straits to which she is reduced. 
He at once invites her and Dominie Sampson to make their home with him and his 
daughter Julia. He has leased a fine estate, and Dominie Sampson rejoices in the 
great collection of books to which Colonel Mannering gives him free access. In 
India Julia had formed an attachment for Vanbeest Brown, a young officer, against 
whom her father feels a strong prejudice. Captain Brown has followed the Mannerings to England; and to make a long story short, is proved in the end to be the long-lost Harry Bertram, and Lucy's brother. The abduction had been accomplished 
with the connivance of Meg Merrilies, a gipsy of striking aspect and six feet tall; of 
Frank Kennedy, a smuggler; Dirk Hatteraick, a Dutch sea-captain, also concerned in 
smuggling; and of Gilbert Glossin, once agent for the Laird of Ellangowan. Glossin
had aimed to get possession of the laird's property, and finally succeeded; but after 
the discovery of his crime, he dies a violent death in prison. 

All told, there are fewer than twoscore characters in 'Guy Mannering' and the 
plot is not very complicated. Meg Merrilies, and Dominie Sampson the uncouth, 
honest pedant, are the only great creations.</summary>

  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Hamlet" print_title="Hamlet">HAMLET is Shakespeare's longest and most famous play. It draws when acted a 
full a house to-day as it ever did. It is the drama of the intellect, of the soul, of man, 
of domestic tragedy. Five quarto editions appeared during the poet's life, the firsl 
in 1603. The story, Shakespeare probably found in 'The Historic of Hamblet,' 
translated from the French of Belleforest, who in turn translated it from the Danish 
History of Saxo Grammaticus. It has been deduced that he drew some of the dramatic 
material from a lost 'Hamlet,' probably the work of Thomas Kyd, the author of the 
popular 'Spanish Tragedy.' Shakespeare's play, like many contemporary tragedies, 
deals with revenge. Some time in winter ("'tis bitter cold"), the scene opens on 
a terrace in front of the castle of Kronberg in Elsinore, Denmark. The ghost of his 
father appears to Hamlet, moody and depressed over his mother's marriage with 
Claudius, her brother-in-law. Hamlet learns from his father the fatal secret of his 
death at the hands of Claudius. He devises the court-play as a trap in which to 
catch his uncle's conscience; breaks his engagement with Ophelia; kills the wary old 
counselor Polonius; and is sent off to England under the escort of the treacherous 
courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to be put to death. On the way he rises 
in the night, unseals their murderous commission, rewrites it, and seals it with his 
father's ring, having worded it so that they themselves shall be the victims when they 
reach England. In a fight with pirates Hamlet boards their ship, and is conveyed 
by them back to Denmark, where he tells his adventures to his faithful friend Horatio. 
At Ophelia's grave he encounters Laertes, her brother; and presently, in a fencing 
bout with him, is killed by Laertes's poisoned sword, but not before he has stabbed his 
treacherous uncle and forced the fatal cup of poison down his throat. His mother 
Gertrude has just died from accidentally drinking the same poison, prepared by the 
King for Hamlet. The old threadbare question, "Was Hamlet insane?" is hardly an 
open question nowadays. The verdict is that he was not. The strain upon his 
nerves of discovering his father's murderer, yet in such a manner that he could not 
prove it (i.e., by the agency of a ghost), was so great that he verges on insanity, and 
this suggests to him the feigning of it. But if you deprive him wholly of reason, you 
destroy our interest in the play. </summary>
  <summary author="Spielhagen, Friedrich (1829-1911)" title="Hammer and Anvil: A Novel" print_title="Hammer and Anvil:\nA Novel">HAMMER AND ANVIL ('Hammer und Amboss'), by Friedrich Spielhagen (1869), 
is a novel grounded on a conception of the continual struggle between castes, arising 
largely from the character of the social institutions of Germany, the nobility, the 
military organization, and the industrial conditions. The leading idea is expressed 
by one of the characters, the humane director of a house of correction, who says: 
"Everywhere is the sorry choice whether we will be the hammer or the anvil" in life. 
And the same character is made to express Spielhagen's solution of the difficulty 
when he says: "It shall not be 'hammer or anvil' but 'hammer and anvil'; for 
everything and every human being is both at once, and every moment."
 
It is not, however, easy to trace the development of this idea as the motive of the 
hook; for the novelist's power lies rather in his charm as a narrator than in constructive strength or analytical ability. In this, as in most of his stories, he obtains 
sympathy for the personalities he creates, and enchains attention by his gift of story-telling. Georg Hartwig, the hero of the novel, is brought into contact with a fallen 
nobleman, a smuggler, "Von Zehren the wild," with his beautiful and heartless 
daughter Constance, and with a contrasted group of honorable and generous persons 
who teach him much. Chief of these is another Von Zehren, the prison director, an 
ideal character. His daughter Paula exercises the influence which opposes that of 
Constance in Hartwig 's life, and leads him to new effort and success. Georg himself 
is one of those who by nature tend to become "anvil" rather than "hammer. " The 
story, though less famous than 'Problematic Characters' or 'Through Night to 
Light,' is a great favorite with German readers.</summary>
  <summary author="Poole, Ernest (1880-1950)" title="The Harbor" print_title="The Harbor">HARBOR, THE, by Ernest Poole (1915). A small boy at church in Brooklyn hears 
Henry Ward Beecher speak of the harbor as a place to come home to rest. He thinks 
the preacher is mistaken, because the back windows and the garden of his home on the 
Heights look down on the harbor, and he knows it is a noisy, strange place of wharves 
inhabited by brutal dockers, and tall ships going to heathen lands. When he grows 
older the harbor still seems to him repeUant and ugly. He goes to Paris to escape 
from the harbor and the drudgery of his father's warehouse, but returns to write 
"glory stories" about the life, energy, and wealth of the harbor. He marries the 
daughter of an engineer, Dillon, who shows him his vision of a harbor organized for 
efficiency, the terminal for the railroads, and he writes a series of articles on "The 
First Port of the World." Another influence is his friend, Joe Kramer, ultra-modern 
socialist, who even in college days scorned the history of the past as "news from 
the graveyard." Joe sees the harbor only as a vast capitalist engine for the crushing 
of human lives. Out of sympathy for the downtrodden, the hero takes part in a 
strike with the dockers, and sees the harbor from their point of view. This experience leaves him a syndicalist, declaring his allegiance to the crowd intelligence, which 
he believes greater than the sum of the individual intelligences which makes it, and 
capable of evolving a solution of the social problem. One god after another proves 
inadequate in the turmoil of life, the "kind god" of his mother's church, the "smiling 
goddess in Paris, " the divinity of art, the "clear-eyed god of efficiency." He elects 
to follow the "awakening god of the crowd, " the god of service. The environment 
throughout is the harbor, in different aspects, seen from docks, tugs, barges, ferry-boats, decks of ocean liners, and in barrooms and tenements. He says, "I have seen 
three harbors; my father's harbor, which is now dead, Dillon's harbor of big companies, which is very much alive, and Joe Kramer's harbor which is struggling to be 
born."</summary>
  <summary author="Reade, Charles (1814-1884)" title="Hard Cash" print_title="Hard Cash">HARD CASH, by Charles Reade. This book, originally published in 1863, as 'Very 
Hard Cash' is an alleged "exposure" of the abuses of private insane asylums in England and of the statutes under which they were sheltered. The "Hard Cash" is the 
sum of 14,000, the earnings of years, of which Richard Hardie, a bankrupt banker, 
defrauds David Dodd, a sea-captain. Dodd has a cataleptic shock and goes insane 
on realizing his loss. Hardie 's son Alfred loves Julia, Dodd's daughter. He detects his father's villainy, accuses him of it, and to insure his silence is consigned by 
his father to a private insane asylum. There he meets Dodd; a fire breaks out, and 
both escape. Dodd enlists and serves as a common seaman, appearing to be capable 
but half-witted, until a second cataleptic shock restores his reason, when he returns 
home. Alfred reaches his friends, and vindicates his sanity in a court of law. The 
receipt for the 14,000 is found, and the money recovered from the elder Hardie. The 
book properly divides itself into two parts. One embraces the maritime adventures 
of Dodd with pirates, storms, shipwreck, and highwaymen, while bringing his money 
home; and his subsequent service as a half-witted foremast-hand until his restoration 
to reason. The other covers Alfred's thrilling experiences as a sane man among the 
insane. The author's analysis of all kinds of insanity is very thorough: with Alfred 
are contrasted Captain Dodd and many asylum patients, introduced incidentally; 
also Maxley, a worthy man driven insane by the bank failure, and who kills Alfred's 
sister in a maniacal rage; Dr. Wycherley, the asylum manager, who has epileptic fits 
himself; Thomas Hardie, Alfred's uncle, who is weak-minded; and others. Dr. 
Sampson, the sturdy Scotch physician, who despises all regular practitioners, and 
comes to Alfred's rescue at the crisis of the book, is one of Reade's strongest and most 
original characters. The love scenes are tender and touching. 'Hard Cash' is in 
some sense a sequel to ' Love me Little, Love me Long, ' which relates the early history 
and marriage of Captain and Mrs. Dodd. This book caused much lively public 
correspondence between the author and various asylum managers, who felt themselves aggrieved, but failed, according to Reade, to shake the facts and arguments 
put forward in this book.</summary>
  <summary author="Dickens, Charles (1812-1870)" title="Hard Times" print_title="Hard Times">HARD TIMES, by Charles Dickens. When 'Hard Times' appeared as a serial in 
Household Words in 1854, Dickens was about midway in his literary career. In 
the same year this novel appeared in an octavo volume with a dedication to Thomas 
Carlyle. Its purpose, according to Dickens himself, was to satirize "those who see 
figures and averages and nothing else the representatives of the wickedest and 
most enormous vice of this time the men who through long years to come will do 
more to damage the really useful facts of Political Economy than I could do (if I 
tried) in my whole life." The satire, however, like much that Dickens attempted 
in the same vein, was not very bitter. 

The characters in 'Hard Times' are not numerous; and the plot itself is less 
intricate than others by the same author. The chief figures are Mr. Thomas Gradgrind, "a man of realities, " with his unbounded faith in statistics; Louisa, his eldest 
daughter; and Josiah Bounderby, as practical as Mr. Gradgrind, but less kind-hearted. Louisa, though many years younger than Mr. Bounderby, is persuaded
by her father to marry him. She is also influenced in making this marriage by her 
desire to smooth the path of her brother Tom, a clerk in Mr. Bounderby's office. 
Though not happy, she resists the blandishments of James Harthouse, a professed 
friend of her husband's. To escape him she has to go home to her father; and this 
leads to a permanent estrangement between husband and wife. In the meantime 
Tom Gradgrind has stolen money from Bounderby, and to avoid punishment runs 
away from England. Thus Louisa's sacrifice of herself has been useless. Mr. 
Gradgrind's wife, and his other children, play an unimportant part in the story. 
Of more consequence is Sissy (Cecilia) Jupe, whom the elder Gradgrind has be-friended in spite of her being the daughter of a circus clown; and Mrs. Sparsit, 
Bounderby's housekeeper, who has seen better days, and is overpowering with her 
relationship to Lady Scadgers. Then there are Mr. McChoakumchild, the statistical 
school-teacher; Bitzer, the satisfactory pupil; and Mr. Sleary and his daughter 
Josephine, as the most conspicuous of the minor characters. Mrs. Pegler, the mother 
of Josiah Bounderby, is a curious and amusing figure; while a touch of pathos is given 
by the love of Stephen Blackpool the weaver, for Rachel, whom he cannot marry 
because his erring wife still lives. 

Mr. Gradgrind came to see the fallacy of mere statistics; but Josiah Bounderby, 
the self-made man, who loved to belittle his own origin, never admitted that he could 
be wrong. When he died, Louisa was still young enough to repair her early mistake 
by a second and happier marriage.</summary>
  <summary author="Lytton, Edward Bulwer Lytton, Baron (1803-1873)" print_title="Harold:\nthe Last of the\nSaxon Kings" title="Harold: the Last of the Saxon Kings">HAROLD, by Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1848) is the dramatic recital of the last 
years of Edward the Confessor's reign, light being thrown upon those events which 
shaped the fortunes of Earl Godwin's son Harold. As in all Lord Lytton's works, 
vivid pictures are presented, sharp contrasts are employed to heighten dramatic 
situations, and inexorable fate plays an important r61e. 

Earl Harold loved Edith the Fair, grandchild of Hilda the Saxon prophetess, and 
goddaughter to Harold's sister, the English queen. Hilda prophesied the union of 
Harold and Edith, though it was forbidden by the Church, they being members of 
the same family through Githa, Harold's mother. 

To remove all doubts Queen Edith desired her goddaughter to enter a nunnery, 
but Harold had his betrothed 's promise to the contrary. 

Duke William of Normandy had spent some time in England visiting King 
Edward; and he coveted the English realm. He had demanded and received as 
hostages Earl Godwin's youngest son, and his grandson Haco also; and when, after 
the old Earl's death, Harold crossed the sea to Normandy to demand back his 
father's hostages, William surrounded him with snares, and finally extorted from 
him a pledge to help forward William's claims in England at Edward's death. Then 
Harold returned home. 

The English theyns, in council assembled, having chosen Harold as Edward's 
successor, the dying king confirmed their choice, and Harold became king. 
Now for State reasons, Harold had to marry Aldyth, the widowed sister of two 
powerful allies, and Edith demanded that he do so for his country's good; and 
so they parted, he to do his country's behest, she to enter a convent to pray 
for him. 

Tostig, Harold's traitor brother, having stirred up strife against him, Harold 
defeated and slew both Tostig and his ally, Hadrad the sea-king. Then came 
William and his Norman array, whom Harold met at Hastings in the autumn of 1066. 
History tells us, as the novelist does, how Harold and all his army were slain; but
the romancer does not stop here. Edith, the Fair, he tells us, came in the night and 
sought among the slain until she found the king. Laying her head upon his breast, 
she died, united to him as Hilda had prophesied.</summary>
  <summary author="Lever, Charles James (1806-1872)" title="The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer" print_title="The Confessions\nof\nHarry Lorrequer">CONFESSIONS OF HARRY LORREQUER, THE, a novel by Charles Lever 
(1839-40). The story is made up of a series of ludicrous adventures, very loosely 
connected. Of some of these Lever was himself the hero; others he gathered from 
his personal friends. Harry Lorrequer has scarcely landed in Cork, after campaigning with Wellington on the Continent, before he is entangled in the most tragic-comic perplexities. His first adventure consists in telling an inoffensive stranger an 
elaborate falsehood, and then shooting him in a duel, without disclosing any reason 
why he should fight at all. The scandalous immorality of the affair is forgotten in 
the grotesque drollery of it. In fact, the most characteristic note of the tale is the 
irresponsibility of every one. Drinking, duelling, getting into love and debt, are 
represented as an Irish gentleman's conception of the whole duty of man. Harry is 
presently sent in disgrace to the dull town of Kilrush. But his banishment is enlivened by every kind of adventure. The scene shifts to Dublin, and we have more 
hoaxes, practical jokes, and blunders. The hero starts "in a yellow postchaise" after 
the Kilkenny Royal Mail, traveling a hundred and fifty miles or so, the coach being 
all the time quietly in the court-yard of the Dublin post-office. We find him next in 
Germany, where he unconsciously hoaxes the Bavarian king and all his court. Lever 
knew the little German towns well, and his descriptions of their ludicrous aspects 
are true. Harry then proceeds to Paris, finds himself in a gambling saloon, and of 
course, breaks the bank. Most of the great men of France are among the gamblers; 
and Talleyrand, Marshal Soult, Balzac, and others, must have been surprised to learn 
of the part they took in the Donnybrook scrimmage with which the affair winds up. 
Finally, Harry weds the girl he has always adored, although his adoration has not 
hindered him from falling in love with scores of other ladies, and proposing marriage 
to some of them.</summary>

story is David Langston, called the Harvester of the Woods, whose wholesome and 
honest nature commands the admiration of all who come in contact with him. When 
David is twenty his mother dies and for the next six years he carries on alone the 
'work they had done together, of raising medicinal plants and herbs, and selling them. 
By great industry and constant study David develops his business until he becomes 
very prosperous and he is beginning to consider the subject of matrimony, when the 
vision of a beautiful girl comes to him, and he is convinced that she is his future wife. 
He at once builds a new house, furnishes it with every comfort and keeps on the 
lookout for the lovely face he saw in his vision. At last David sees his "dream-girl" 
alighting from a train but loses her immediately. He searches for her unceasingly 
and finally discovers her living with a cruel uncle who treats her shamefully. After 
a few meetings David begs his " dream-girl, " whose name is Ruth Jameson, to marry 
him at once for protection if for nothing more, and she agrees to do so. David takes 
his wife to her new home, provides her with everything she can desire, and tells her she 
shall remain his honored guest until he succeeds in winning her love. The devotion 
and goodness of her husband win Ruth's affection but do not kindle the love which 
David craves. Ruth has a severe illness and David sends for Dr. Harmon for whom 
she had previously cared and offers to relinquish her to him if it is for her happiness. 
Ruth, however, soon tires of Dr. Harmon and David saves her life with one of his 
herb remedies when the doctors have given her up. Finally David sends Ruth 
on a long visit to her grandparents whom she has never seen on account of 
their estrangement from her parents, and the separation from David causes the 
awakening of the deep love for her husband for which he has longed and labored 
so patiently. </summary>
  <summary author="Peacock, Thomas Love (1785-1866)" title="Headlong Hall" print_title="Headlong Hall">HEADLONG HALL, by Thomas Love Peacock. Written in 1815, 'Headlong Hall' 
is a study of typical English life put into the form of numerous detached conversations, 
discussions, and descriptions. At first it tells how invitations have been sent to a 
perfectibilian, a deteriorationist, a statu-quo-ite, and a reverend doctor who had won 
the squire's fancy by a learned dissertation on the art of stuffing a turkey. There is a 
graphic picture of the squire at breakfast. After the arrival of tLe guests they are 
taken over the grounds, dined, f6ted, taken to walk, introduced to the tower, and 
given a ball. In the interim one of them discovers the skull of Cadwallader and begs 
possession of it from the old sexton, and being somewhat of a physiologist, follows his 
discovery with a learned dissertation on the animal man. The whole story is bright, 
witty, humorous, devoid of plot, and elaborate in its phrasing. It is engaging as a 
relic of old English life. Mr. Peacock was born in 1785, and died in 1866. The 
present is perhaps a little better known than any of his other seven books, though
'Gryll Grange,' 'Crotchet Castle,' and ' Nightmare Abbey ' are also to be reckoned 
among standard, if not classical, English literature. The story is distinguished by a 
display of varied erudition, and is to some extent, like his other books, a satire on 
well-known characters and fads of the day.</summary>
  <summary author="Fox, John (1863-1919)" title="The Heart of the Hills" print_title="The Heart of the Hills">HEART OF THE HELLS, THE, by John Fox, Jr. (1913). The scene of this story 
is laid in the hills of Kentucky and it deals for the most part with the lives of the 
mountaineers. The principal character is Jason Hawn, who, when first introduced 
to the reader, is a small boy living with his widowed mother in a cabin in the hills. 
His father having been mysteriously shot by an unknown assassin, had told Jason 
on his death-bed to hunt down his murderer and avenge his death. As a feud of 
long standing had existed between the Hawns and the Honeycutts, a member of the 
latter clan is supposed to have committed the deed. Jason grows up with a bitter 
hatred for the Honeycutts and looks forward to the time when he shall avenge his 
father's murder. He has a pretty cousin of about his own age named Mavis Hawn
who is devoted to him and has in him a warm champion. Steve Hawn, Mavis's 
father, a tricky and shiftless fellow, after a period of widowerhood marries Jason's 
mother much to the son's disappointment and grief. Steve persuades his wife to sell 
land, upon which Jason had discovered coal, and though the latter had not divulged 
his secret he had exacted from his mother a promise not to sell without his knowledge. 
The purchaser of the land is Colonel Pendleton, who represents a large company, and 
he has a son named Gray, who is about the age of Jason. Gray and his pretty little 
cousin Marjorie are brought by the Colonel to the hills where they meet Jason and 
Mavis and are strangely attracted to these children who are so different in manners 
and speech. Later Jason and Mavis go to school and then to college where they find 
themselves fellow-students with Gray and Marjorie. Here the old attraction reasserts itself and Gray and Mavis, and Marjorie and Jason, find themselves drawn to 
each other. Eventually however, both couples realize the inappropriateness of their 
union, and the book closes with the readjustment of their love affairs and the marriage 
of Gray and Marjorie, followed by that of Jason and Mavis. Previous to this Jason 
had inadvertently avenged his father's death by shooting a prowler, who was robbing 
Colonel Pendleton's estate after having committed many other crimes and acts of 
lawlessness. The robber proved to be Steve Hawn, and after his death, Jason's 
mother tells him he was the man who shot his father. Jason becomes a civil engineer 
and the reader takes leave of him as superintendent of the coal mines which are being 
developed upon his old property.</summary>
  <summary author="Grand, Sarah (1854-1943)" title="The Heavenly Twins" print_title="The Heavenly Twins">HEAVENLY TWINS, THE, by Madame Sarah Grand (1893), is the novel 
which brought the author into notice and aroused great discussion for and against 
the book. It is a study of the advanced modern woman. The heroine, Evadne, 
finds herself married to a man of social position whose past has been impure. She 
therefore leaves him, to the scandal of her friends. An episode called 'The Tenor 
and the Boy,' bearing little relation to the main story but pleasing in itself, is then 
interpolated: it narrates the love between a male churchsinger and a lad who turns 
out to be a girl, one of the twins in disguise. The character of these twins, a pair of 
precocious, forward youngsters, boy and girl, is sketched amusingly in the early
portion of the story. After the separation from her husband, Evadne leads a life of 
protest against society as it exists, and her sorrow and disillusionment prey upon her 
health to such an extent that her complex nervous system suffers from hysteria. Dr. 
Galbraith, the physician who narrates this phase of her career, becomes her husband; 
and in his professional care and honest love Evadne bids fair to find both physical and 
moral peace. The novel is too long, has grave faults of construction, and contains 
material for three separate stories and a tract on women's rights. But it was at once 
recognized as a sympathetic presentation of some of the social wrongs of women.</summary>
  <summary author="Ibsen, Henrik (1828-1906)" title="Hedda Gabler" print_title="Hedda Gabler">HEDDA GABLER, a play by Henrik Ibsen (1890). A remarkable study of the 
character of a selfish, hard-hearted woman endowed with beauty, good taste, education, and culture, but spiritually a monster. She is kept from expressing her evil 
genius only by cowardly fear of public opinion. In the discord of a dull cramping 
environment she has not courage to free herself and is shipwrecked. The play begins 
as Hedda and her husband return from their wedding trip, and Hedda reveals her 
character immediately by her unkind treatment of her husband's old aunt, who comes 
to welcome her. The aristocrat, Hedda, daughter of General Gabler, has married a 
kindly but stupid Ph.D., chiefly because he promised to buy her a certain luxurious 
villa she coveted for her home. His pedantry bores her. She has miscalculated his 
professional future as well as his income; and she dreads the prospect of a child. 
Before her marriage she had enjoyed an intimate friendship with a drunken dissipated 
young genius, Lovberg. He had misinterpretated her morbid curiosity about the 
details of his dissipation and they parted in a theatrical scene in which Hedda repelled his advances with her father's pistol. Lovberg becomes tutor to the step-children of Thea Elsted, who reclaims the degenerate genius with her sympathy and 
interest, and inspires him to write the book which brings him fame. Thea defies the 
conventions to follow him to the city, knowing that without her influence he will 
relapse into drunkenness and dissipation. The heartless Hedda, jealous of his good 
angel, contrives to make him fall into his old evil ways, simply to demonstrate her 
power over him. He loses the manuscript of his second book, which by perverse 
chance comes into Hedda 's possession. She conceals it and malignantly burns it, 
giving as excuse to her husband, that Lovberg is his rival for a professorship. Lovberg accuses a disreputable woman of stealing the manuscript and gets into a brawl 
with the police in her house. He confesses the loss of the manuscript and the scandal 
to Hedda, and she presents him with one of her father's brace of pistols, advising him 
"to die beautifully." Later he returns to the woman, and in a violent quarrel is 
fatally shot in the stomach with the pistol. Hedda had indulged in a dangerous 
friendship with Judge Brack, an elderly rake, who recognizes the pistol and threatens 
to expose Hedda to the scandal she dreads, in order to get her in his power. While 
Thea and Tessman are planning the reconstruction of Lovberg's book, Hedda goes 
to the back of the room and kills herself with a pistol shot in the head.</summary>

This chronicle of the kings of Norway (from the earliest times down to 1177), sometimes known as the 'Younger Edda' 
or the 'Mythic Ring of the World,' was originally written in Icelandic, in the early 
part of the thirteenth century. It has always been a household word in the home of 
every peasant in Iceland, and is entertaining reading to those who read for mere 
amusement, as well as to the student of history; being full of incident and anecdote, 
told with racy simplicity, and giving an accurate picture of island life at that early 
day. Short pieces of scaldic poetry originally recited by bards are interspersed, being
quoted by Snorri as his authorities for the facts he tells. The writer, born in Iceland 
in 1178, was educated by a grandson of Saemund Sigfusson, author of the 'Elder 
Edda,' who doubtless turned his pupil's thoughts in the direction of this book. A 
descendant of the early kings, he would naturally like to study their history. He 
became chief magistrate of Iceland, took an active part in politics, and was murdered 
in 1241 by his two sons-in-law, at the instigation of King Hakon. His book was first 
printed in 1697, in a Latin translation, having been inculcated in manuscript, or by 
word of mouth, up to that time. It was afterwards translated into Danish and 
English, and may be regarded as a classic work.</summary>

interesting love story, and gives a picture of the home life of an English family in the 
country. 

Sir Guy Morville, the attractive young hero, leaves Redclyffe after the death of 
his grandfather, and becomes a member of his guardian's large household. Many 
incidents are related of his life there with Laura, Amy, and Charlotte, their lame 
brother Charles, and his own sedate, antagonistic cousin, Philip Morville. At the 
end of three years he and Amy confess their love for each other; but as he is still a 
youth, no engagement is made, and at the advice of his guardian he leaves Hollywell. 
Philip wrongly suspects Guy of gambling, and tells his guardian his suspicions. Guy 
has paid his uncle's gaming debts, and when called upon for an explanation he is too 
generous to clear his character at his uncle's expense. He is banished from Hollywell, 
and returns to Redclyffe at the end of the Oxford term. At Redclyffe Guy bravely 
rescues some shipwrecked men after a storm at sea, and before long his reputation is 
restored by his uncle. He returns to Hollywell, finds that Amy has been true to him, 
and they are married. They go abroad for their wedding journey; and after a few 
weeks of mutual happiness, they learn that Philip is sick with a fever in Italy. Guy 
overlooks past injustice, they go to him, and Guy nurses him through a severe illness. 
He takes the fever himself and dies shortly afterwards, leaving Amy to mourn his loss 
for the rest of her life. The story ends with the marriage of Philip and Laura, who 
had long been secretly engaged; and as Guy's child is a girl, Philip inherits 
Redclyffe. 

The two characters which stand out in the book are Guy Morville, generous, 
manly, bright, and of a lovable disposition; and Philip, stern, honorable, self-esteeming, and unrelentingly prejudiced against Guy until Guy's unselfish nobility of 
conduct forces him to humble contrition.</summary>

one of the successful novels of the year. The scene is laid in France at the time that 
Henry of Navarre is about to ascend the throne, and deals with the adventures of 
Felix Broux, a youth whose family had for centuries faithfully served the Dukes of 
St. Quentin. At a time when his master, as an open enemy of the League, is in great 
danger, Broux goes to Paris to join him and immediately finds himself involved in all 
sorts of intrigues and difficulties. The Duke of St. Quentin and his son, the Comte de 
Mar, have become estranged through the villainies of one Lucas, who is employed 
as the Duke's secretary, but, who in reality is a spy of the League. Young Broux 
is the means of bringing about a reconciliation between father and son, and of exposing the evil machinations of Lucas, and afterwards serves De Mar with unfailing 
loyalty and ingenuity. He proves to be an invaluable aid in the love affair of the 
Comte and Lorance de Montluc, the ward of Monsieur de Mayenne, and helps to 
bring the lovers together in spite of the many difficulties placed in their way. Lucas, 
the evil genius of the story, weaves plot after plot to bring the St. Quentins to ruin, 
and time after time when on the very brink of destruction they are saved by chance or 
strategy. The book is full of adventures and hairbreadth escapes, has snares and 
secret passages, mysterious inns and rascally landlords, and plenty of sword play.

sympathetic study of the married life of a sinner and a saint, in which one's sympathies are always with the sinner. The theme is that sin is more often weakness than 
wickedness, and that goodness can as often be pride as holiness. While Walter and 
Anne Majendie are on their honeymoon, rumors reach the wife that seven years 
before he knew her, her husband had had a liaison with an older married woman. 
He had reason to suppose that Anne had been exactly informed concerning this affair 
before her marriage. In her eyes he is a moral leper. Though a man of no great 
force he has unusual sweetness of temper, and waits patiently for his wife to respond 
to his devoted affection. He is constitutionally incapable of sinking to the depths 
of abasement and perpetual expiation to which she condemns him. The cold virtue 
of his wife finally drives him to seek consolation in clandestine relations with a little 
shop girl. Their child dies while Walter is away from home. His grief and strain 
and Anne's accusations and reproaches precipitate a paralytic stroke. She nurses
him back to health and in the end all is well, since Anne through suffering comes to 
realize her own shortcomings, after nine tragic years of misunderstanding.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="King Henry IV, Part 1" print_title="King Henry IV,\nPart 1">KING HENRY IV, by Shakespeare, Part I, stands at the head of all Shakespeare's historical comedies, as Falstaff is by far his best humorous character. The two parts 
of the drama were first published in 1598 and 1600 respectively, the source-texts for 
both being Holinshed's 'Chronicles' and the old play, 'The famous Victories of 
Henry the Fifth.' The contrasted portraits of the impetuous Hotspur (Henry 
Percy) and the chivalric Prince Henry in Part i., are masterly done. King Henry, 
with the crime of Richard II's death on his conscience, was going on a crusade, to 
divert attention from himself; but Glendower and Hotspur give him his hands full at 
home. Hotspur has refused to deliver up certain prisoners taken on Holmedon field: 
" My liege, I did deny no prisoners, " he says in the well-known speech painting to the 
life the perfumed dandy on the field of battle. However, the Percys revolt from the 
too haughty monarch; and at Shrewsbury the Hotspur faction, greatly outnumbered 
by the King's glittering host, is defeated, and Percy himself slain by Prince Harry. 
For the humorous portions we have first the broad talk of the carriers in the inn-yard at Rochester; then the night robbery at Gadshill, where old Jack frets like a 
gummed varlet, and lards the earth with perspiration as he seeks his horse hidden by 
Bardolph behind a hedge. Prince Hal and Poins rob the robbers. Falstaff and his 
men hack their swords, and tickle their noses with grass to make them bleed. Then 
after supper, at the Boar's Head, in slink the disappointed Falstaffians, and Jack 
regales the Prince and Poins with his amusing whoppers about the dozen or so of 
rogues in Kendal green that set upon them at Gadshill. Hal puts him down with a 
plain tale. Great hilarity all around. Hal and Jack are in the midst of a mutual 
mock-judicial examination when the sheriff knocks at the door. The fat knight falls 
asleep behind the arras, and has his pockets picked by the Prince. Next day the 
latter has the money paid back, and he and Falstaff set off for the seat of war, Jack 
marching by Coventry with his regiment of tattered prodigals. Attacked by Douglas 
in the battle, Falstaff falls, feigning death. He sees the Prince kill Hotspur, and 
afterwards rises, gives the corpse a fresh stab, lugs it off on his back, and swears he 
and Hotspur fought a good hour by Shrewsbury clock, and that he himself killed 
him. The prince magnanimously agrees to gild the lie with the happiest terms he 
has, if it will do his old friend any grace. </summary>

1599, printed in 1600, the materials being derived from the same sources as are given 
above. Henry IV. is dead, and bluff King Hal is showing himself to be every inch a 
king. His claim to the crown of France is solemnly sanctioned. The Dauphin has 
sent him his merry mock of tennis balls, and got his stern answer. The traitors 
Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey have been sent to their death. The choice youth 
of England (and some riff-raff, too, such as Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol) have embarked at Southampton, and the threaden sails have drawn the huge bottoms 
through the sea to France. The third act opens in the very heat of an attack upon 
the walls of the seaport of Harfleur, and King Harry is urging on his men in that 
impassioned speech "Once more unto the breach, dear friends" which thrills 
the heart like a slogan in battle. We also catch glimpses of the army in Picardy, and 
finally see it on the eve of Agincourt. The night is rainy and dark, the hostile camps 
are closely joined. King Henry, cheerful and strong, goes disguised through his 
camp, and finds that whatever the issue of the war may be, he is expected to bear all 
the responsibility. A private soldier Williams impeaches the King's good 
faith, and the disguised Henry accepts his glove as a gauge and challenge for the 
morrow. Day dawns, the fight is on, the dogged English win the day. Then, as a 
relief to his nerves, Henry has his bit of fun with Williams, who has sworn to box the 
ear of the man caught wearing the mate of his glove. The wooing by King Henry of 
Kate, the French King's daughter, ends the play. But all through the drama runs 
also a comic vein. The humorous characters are Pistol, now married to Nell 
Quickly, Bardolph, Nym, and Fluellen, Falstaff, his heart "fracted and corroborate" by the King's casting of him off, and babbling o' green fields, has "gone to 
Arthur's bosom." His followers are off for the wars. At Harfleur, Bardolph, of the 
purple and bubuMed nose, cries, "On to the breach!" very valorously, but is soon 
hanged for robbing a church. Le grand Capitaine Pistol so awes a poor Johnny 
Crapaud of a prisoner that he offers him two hundred crowns in ransom. Pistol fires 
off some stinging bullets of wit at the Saint Tavy's day leek in the cap of Fluellen, 
who presently makes him eat a leek, giving him the cudgel over the head for sauce. 
The blackguard hies him home to London to swear he got his scalp wound in 
the wars.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Henry VIII" print_title="Henry VIII">KING HENRY VIII, a historical drama by Shakespeare (first printed in 1623), based on 
Edward Hall's 'Union of the Families of Lancaster and York, 7 Holinshed's 'Chronicles,' and Fox's 'Acts and Monuments of the Church.' The key-idea is the mutability of earthly grandeur, and by one or another turn of Fortune's wheel, the over-throw of the mighty i.e., of the Duke of Buckingham, of Cardinal Wolsey, and of 
Queen Katharine. The action covers a period of sixteen years, from the Field of the 
Cloth of Gold, in 1520, described in the opening pages, to the death of Queen Katharine in 1536. It is the trial and divorce of this patient, queenly, and unfortunate 
woman, that forms the main subject of the drama. She was the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile, and born in 1485. She had been married when seventeen to Arthur, eldest son of Henry VII. Arthur lived only five months after his 
marriage, and when at seventeen years Henry VIII. came to the throne (that "most 
hateful ruffian and tyrant"), he married Katharine, then twenty-four. She bore him 
children, and he never lost his respect for her and her unblemished life. But twenty 
years after his marriage he met Anne Bullen at a merry ball at Cardinal Wolsey's 
palace, and fell in love with her, and immediately conceived conscientious scruples 
against the legality of his marriage. Queen Katharine is brought to trial before a
solemn council of nobles and churchmen. With fine dignity she appeals to the Pope 
and leaves the council, refusing then and ever after to attend "any of their courts." 
The speeches are masterpieces of pathetic and noble defense. In all his facts the 
poet follows history very faithfully. The Pope goes against her, and she is divorced 
and sequestered at Kimbolton, where presently she dies heart-broken, sending a dying 
message of love to Henry. Intertwined with the sad fortunes of the queen are the 
equally crushing calamities that overtake Cardinal Wolsey. His high-blown pride, 
his oppressive exactions in amassing wealth greater than the king's, his ego et rex 
meus, his double dealing with Henry in securing the Pope's sanction to the divorce, 
these and other things are the means whereby his many enemies work his ruin. 
He is stripped of all his dignities and offices, and wanders away, an old man broken 
with the storms of State, to lay his bones in Leicester Abbey. The episode of the 
trial of Archbishop Cranmer is so pathetically handled as to excite tears. He is 
brought to trial for heresy by his enemy Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, but has 
previously been moved to tears of gratitude by Henry's secretly bidding him be of 
good cheer, and giving him his signet ring as a talisman to conjure with if too hard 
pressed by his enemies. Henry is so placed as to oversee (himself unseen) Cranmer's 
trial and the arrogant persecution of Gardiner. Cranmer produces the ring just as 
they are commanding him to be led away to the Tower; and Henry steps forth to first 
rebuke his enemies and then command them to be at peace. He does Cranmer the 
high honor of asking him to become a godfather to the daughter (Elizabeth) of Anne 
Bullen; and after Cranmer's eloquent prophecy at the christening, the curtain 
falls. The setting of this play is full of rich and magnificent scenery and 
spectacular pomp.</summary>
  <summary author="Chesterton, G. K. (Gilbert Keith) (1874-1936)" title="Heretics" print_title="Heretics">HERETICS, a volume of essays by Gilbert K. Chesterton, published in 1905. Although they deal with a varied assortment of writers and topics (Kipling, Bernard 
Shaw, H. G. Wells, George Moore, Lewes Dickinson, Omar and the Sacred Vine, 
Celts and Celtophiles, Science and the Savages) they are unified by the idea that 
however heretical the authors discussed may be "they do, each of them, have a 
constructive and affirmative view and they do take it seriously and ask us to take it 
seriously." Kipling is preaching imperialism, Shaw and Wells socialism. They are, 
in various degrees, heretics; but they consider themselves orthodox; that is they 
believe themselves in possession of the truth and wish to share it with others. But 
for the heretic who believes in nothing, who will form no general ideas, who thinks 
that "everything matters except everything," Chesterton has only contempt. 
Against this modern disposition to renounce all seriousness of conviction, to consider 
everyone a heretic and to use orthodoxy as a term of reproach, the whole book is a 
protest; and in spite of its title it may therefore be called a plea for orthodoxy. 
Chesterton's characteristic fondness for established customs and institutions, for 
material comforts and luxuries, for faith and conviction, and for the paradoxical 
expression of conservative views appear on every page of this stimulating volume.</summary>
  <summary author="Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von (1749-1832)" title="Hermann and Dorothea" print_title="Hermann and Dorothea">HERMANN AND DOROTHEA, by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, is a German idyllic 
pastoral of about 2000 hexameter lines. The scene is the broad Rhineplain, and 
the time the poet's own. This poem, considered the finest specimen of Goethe's 
narrative verse, was published in 1797, during the period of the author's inspiring 
friendship with Schiller. The sweet bucolic narrative describes how the host of the 
Golden Lion and his "sensible wife" have sent their stalwart and dutiful son, Hermann, to minister to the wants of a band of exiles, who are journeying from their 
homes, burned by the ravages of war. Among the exiles Hermann meets, and immediately loves, Dorothea. How this buxom Teutonic maiden of excellent good sense is 
wooed and won, taking a daughter's place in the cheerful hostelry, is told with 
charming simplicity. </summary>
  <summary author="Carlyle, Thomas (1795-1881)" title="On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History" print_title="On Heroes,\nHero-Worship,\nand the\nHeroic in History">ON HEROES, HERO-WORSHIP, AND THE HEROIC IN HISTORY, by Thomas 
Carlyle. Carlyle's 'Hero-Worship' made its first appearance as a series of lectures 
delivered orally in 1840. They were well attended, and were so popular that in book 
form they had considerable success when published in 1841. 

There are five lectures in all, each dealing with some one type of hero. In the 
first, it is the Hero as Divinity, and in this the heroic divinities of Norse mythology 
are especially considered. Carlyle finds this type earnest and sternly impressive. 

The second considers the Hero as Prophet, with especial reference to Mahomet and 
Islam. He chose Mahomet, he himself says, because he was the prophet whom he felt 
the freest to speak of. 

As types of the Poet Hero in his third lecture, he brings forward Dante and 
Shakespeare. "As in Homer we may still construe old Greece; so in Shakespeare and 
Dante, after thousands of years, what our modern Europe was in faith and in practice 
will still be legible." 

In the fourth lecture he considered the Hero as Priest, singling out Luther and the 
Reformation and Knox and Puritanism. "These two men we will account our best 
priests, inasmuch as they were our best reformers." 

The Hero as Man of Letters, with Johnson, Rousseau, and Burns as his types, 
forms the subject of Carlyle's fifth lecture. "I call them all three genuine Men, more 
or less; faithfully, for the most part unconsciously, struggling to be genuine, and plant 
themselves on the everlasting truth of things." 

Finally, for the Hero as King he selects as the subject of his sixth lecture Cromwell 
and Napoleon, together with the modern Revolutionism which they typify. "The commander over men he is practically the summary for us of all the 
various figures of Heroism; Priest, Teacher, whatever of earthly or of spiritual 
dignity we can fancy to reside in a man, embodies itself here." 

Carlyle eulogizes his heroes for the work that they have done in the world. His 
tone, however, is that of fraternizing with them rather than of adoring them. He 
holds up his typical heroes as patterns for other men of heroic mold to imitate, and 
he makes it clear that he expects the unheroic masses to adore them. The style of 
'Hero-Worship' is clearer than that in most of the other masterpieces of Carlyle, and 
on this account is much more agreeable to the average reader. There is less exaggeration, less straining after epigram.</summary>
  <summary author="Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth (1807-1882)" title="The Song of Hiawatha" print_title="The Song\nof\nHiawatha">HIAWATHA, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a narrative poem based on traditions of the North American Indians, was published in 1855. It deals with the 
exploits of a culture-hero of various names, Michabou, Chiabo, Manabozho, Tarenya wagon, Hiawatha the last and most melodious of which was chosen by the 
poet. The traditions of his birth, childhood, marriage, prodigious feats, invention of 
agriculture and writing, and departure to the kingdom of the blest before the coming 
of the white men are drawn from the various collections of Indian anthropology and 
folk-lore by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft (particularly 'Algic Researches' 1839), from 
George Catlin's 'Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the 
North American Indians' (1841), and from other works of travel and topography. 
The metre of the poem (unrhymed trochaic octosyllabic) and certain incidents, such 
as the building of Hiawatha's canoe, his fight with the magician, Pearl-Feather, the 
objections of Nokomis to the marriage with a stranger, and the marvellous music of 
Chibiabos, were taken from the Finnish popular epic, the Kalevala, which Longfellow knew in a German translation and which depicted a similar hero and a similar 
stage of national culture. Hiawatha comprises in a remarkable way practically all 
that was then known of the beliefs, songs, dances, stories, superstitions, manners, and 
customs of the North American Indians; and all this antiquarian matter is skillfully 
interwoven into a fascinating heroic story. The locality selected is the abode of the 
Ojibways on the north coast of Lake Superior. Here Hiawatha is reared by his 
grandmother, Nokomis, daughter of the moon, is made a brother to the birds and 
animals, and learns their language. Growing older he becomes a mighty hunter and 
secures magic mittens which will crush rocks and magic moccasins which enable 
him to take a stride a mile in length. His first exploit is to seek vengeance on his 
father, the West Wind, Mudjekeewis, for wrong committed against his mother, 
Wenonah. The fight ends in a reconciliation and Hiawatha returns to be a defender 
and civilizer of his people. Through fasting and vigil he has revealed to him the 
corn-spirit, Mondarm'n, with whom he wrestles, and from whose buried body springs 
the Indian corn or maize, the food of the people. Then follow, the making of Hiawatha's canoe, his marvellous contest with the sturgeon, Nahma, who swallows both 
canoe and warrior, his destruction of the baleful magician, Pearl-Feather, his marriage 
to Minnehaha of the Dacotahs, the songs and stories of the wedding-feast, the 
blessing of the cornfields by Minnehaha, the invention of picture-writing, the death 
of his three friends, Chibiabos the musician, Pau-Pulc-Keewis, the ne'er-do-well, 
and the strong man, Kwasind, the coming of the ghosts of the departed, the death of 
Minnehaha from famine and fever, the coming of the missionary priest, and the 
departure of Hiawatha for the distant islands of the blest in the kingdom of the 
North- West wind, Keewaydin, over which he was to rule. 'Hiawatha* is a truly 
American poem, preserving in delightful poetic form the characteristics of the 
continent before its conquest by the whites. The rhythm has been charged with 
monotony and the narrative with prolixity; but the former is adapted to the primitive 
life depicted and the latter is constantly enlivened by striking incident and local 
color.</summary>

story of an elderly man with a family of three grown daughters. Roger Gale comes 
from the New Hampshire farm of his forefathers to "young New York" "a city of 
houses, separate homes" turbulent "thoroughfares of shouting drivers," of thrilling 
enterprise compared with the "old New York" he heard about from his elders. He 
had promised his wife to live on in his children's lives, but after her death he had 
fallen into a lethargy, and it is twenty years later, when he is nearly sixty, that he 
tries to fulfil his promise and awakens to the tremendous modern New York of his 
children's lives. Edith the oldest daughter is a too devoted mother to her five 
children; even-one is sacrificed to her little family. Deborah, who is her father's 
close friend, is principal of a high school in the tenement house district; her vision of 
maternity includes the thousands of pitiful, striving, aspiring children she is making 
into good citizens, and she postpones marriage with the man she loves because she 
fears a child of her own might force her to choose between her work and the narrow 
motherhood of which her sister Edith is such an awful example. Laura, the young 
worldly pleasure-loving member of the family, marries a wealthy young New Yorker, 
and does not intend to be bothered with any children. She is divorced while still in 
her twenties to marry another man of the same sort, and triumphantly lives her own 
gay luxurious life. Edith's husband dies and her father ultimately provides for her 
with the old New Hampshire home, where her domestic tyranny is more circumscribed 
than in New York. His great achievement is to clear the way for Deborah's happiness; she marries and has her son and her school family also. In each of his children, 
he has seen some phase of his own life repeated.</summary>

College. Here Professor Kelton, retired from active labor, lives a quiet and secluded 
life with his grand-daughter Sylvia Garrison. The latter, a girl of sixteen, has lived 
with her grandfather since the death of her mother, his only child, which occurred 
when she was but three years old. Her antecedents are mysterious and even the 
Professor does not know who her father was, as her mother made a runaway match 
while away from home and kept her husband's identity a secret for some unexplained 
reason. Her short married life was spent in the Adirondacks in seclusion and when 
illness overtook her, she started to take her child to her father, but died before 
reaching him. No clue could be found to the husband, who had evidently deserted 
his young wife, and so Sylvia was cared for by her grandfather. She was taught 
by him until fitted for college which she was enabled to attend through the generosity 
of an old friend of the professor's, Airs. Owen. The latter's niece is the wife of 
Morton Bassett, a prominent politician, unscrupulous and ambitious. His private 
secretary is Daniel Harwood, a Yale graduate, sound mentally and morally. Harwood 
loves Sylvia who refuses him, and retains his association with Bassett until the latter 
in his race for the senatorship employs methods which Harwood cannot endorse. 
A political rival unearths an episode in Bassett's early life which has been carefully 
hidden, and which he intends to divulge at the convention to the detriment of 
Bassett. It relates t@ his connection with an unknown woman and child in the 
Adirondacks and these are proven to be Sylvia and her mother. When Sylvia 
discovers the identity of her father she goes to "Him for an explanation and he tells 
her that his marriage to her mother was legal and his desertion of her unintentional. 
Sylvia tells him that to make reparation to her mother he must give up the senatorship, and though it has been the ambition of his life he does so. Sylvia marries 
Harwood, whom she had previously refused because of the mystery surrounding 
her birth.</summary>

a blacksmith; Mary Musgrove and her lover John Ramsay; Henry and Mildred 
Lyndsay, ardent patriots; Mildred's lover, Arthur Butler, whom she secretly marries; 
Habershaw and his band of ruffians and brutal Indians. The scene is laid in Virginia

does Butler much harm, but is finally hanged as a traitor, while Mildred and her 
husband live happily after the war is ended. Horseshoe Robinson is a "character": 
huge in size, of Herculean strength and endless craft and cunning. His adventures 
by flood and field are well worth reading. The story was written in 1835. Though 
not his first novel, it is perhaps the most famous work of the author.</summary>

two children. The wise man is to explain to his pupils a passage in the book before 
him which says: " There are two living countries, the one visible and the one invisible 
. . . the learned in old times forgot the visible country." He thinks he has taught 
his pupils better than that. The fool asks for pennies and says he has seen that 
priests and people on account of the wise man's teaching have given up their old
religious observances. The fool says that he often sees acgels, the wise man that 
he has shut people's ears to "the imaginary harpings and speech of the angels." 
While he is yet speaking, an angel appears to him and tells him that he will die within 
the hour, because no souls have passed over the threshold of heaven since he came 
to the country. He pleads without avail for mercy from the angel, but is told that 
if before the last sands have run from the hour glass he can find one who believes, 
he shall come to heaven after years of purgatory. His pupils and the fool enter. 
None of his pupils believe. His wife says that a good wife only believes what her

orphan she is given a home and an allowance by her aunt Mrs. Peniston, with whom 
she lives, but having expensive tastes, her limited resources and dependence make 
her very dissatisfied with her lot. Her ambition and desire has been to make a 
successful marriage, having been reared by a selfish and worldly mother with that 
end in view, but so far, her aim has not been accomplished. She visits her rich 
friends the Gus Trenors and loses heavily at bridge thereby involving herself in debt 
from which she allows her host to extricate her. He offers to invest her small capital 
in a way to bring in large returns and Lily being ignorant of business methods does 
not realize the large checks he hands her are out of his own pocket. Trenor endeavors 
to force his attentions upon her and when she repulses him he taunts her with having 
taken his money. Lily is terrified and says she will repay every cent. Meantime 
she has several suitors; among these is Lawrence Selden, an attractive man without 
money for whom she really cares, and a rich Jew named Simon Rosedale, who is 
personally repulsive to her. The former, she feels she cannot consider on account of 
his limited income, and although the latter would bring her the wealth she craves 
she cannot bring herself to accept him. Lily goes on a yachting-trip with her friends 
the Dorsets and through no fault of her own becomes involved in a scandal which

difficult and finally brings up in a cheap boarding-house while learning the trade of 
milliner. During her declining fortunes she has reconsidered her decision regarding 
Rosedale but finds to her chagrin that he no longer cares to many her. Broken in 
health and completely discouraged Lily finally takes an overdose of chloral which 
ends her unhappy existence. Just before this tragic event she visits Selden and tells 
him how much he has been to her, and he is on his way to ask her to many him when

romances, follows the fortunes of a decayed New England family, consisting of four 
members, Hephzibah Pyncheon, her brother Clifford, their cousin Judge Pyncheon, and another cousin, Phcebe, a country girl. At the time the story opens 
Hephzibah is living in great poverty at the old homestead, the House of the Seven 
Gables. With her is Clifford, just released from prison, where he had served a term 
of thirty years for the supposed murder of a rich uncle. Judge Pyncheon, who was 
influential in obtaining the innocent Clifford's arrest, that he might hide his own 
wrong-doing, now seeks to confine him in an asylum on the charge of insanity. 
Hephzibah's pitiful efforts to shield this brother, to support him and herself by 
keeping a centshop, to circumvent the machinations of the judge, are described 
through the greater portion of the novel. The sudden death of the malevolent cousin 
frees them and makes them possessors of his wealth. A lighter episode of the story is 
the wooing of little Phcebe by Holgrave, a lodger in the old house. 'The House of 
the Seven Gables' has about it the same dreamy atmosphere that envelops Hawthorne's other novels. The usual background of mystery is supplied in the hereditary 
curse resting upon the Pyncheon family. Hephzibah, the type of ineffectual, 
decayed aristocracy, the sensitive feeble Clifford, the bright little flower Phoebe, are 
prominent portraits in the author's strange gallery of New England types.</summary>

  <summary author="Morris, William (1834-1896)" title="The House of the Wolfings" print_title="The House\nof the\nWolfings">HOUSE OF THE WOLFINGS, THE, by William Morris (1889). "The tale tells 
that in times long past, there was a dwelling of men beside a great wood." Thus 
does the first sentence of the book take us into the atmosphere half real, half 
mystical, and wholly poetic which pervades the entire story. These "men"
belonged to one of the Germanic tribes of Central Europe. Round about this "great
wood" were three settlements or "Marks," each mark containing many Houses; and 
it is with the House of the Wolfings of Mid-mark that the tale chiefly deals. 

The chief of the Wolfings was Thiodolf, the wisest man, and of heart most dauntless. Hall-Sun, his daughter, exceeding fair and with the gift of prophecy, was first 
among the women. 

The leading theme of the story is the war between the Romans and the Markmen; 
how it fared with Thiodolf, and how the Hall-Sun advises the Stay-at-Homes by 
means of her wonderful insight. Thiodolf is chosen War-Duke. He meets the WoodSun, his beloved, a woman descended from the gods. She gives him a hauberk to 
wear in battle; but owing to a charm that caused who so wore this armor to weaken 
in war, Thiodolf does not acquit himself bravely in their first skirmishes with the 
foe. The Markmen become somewhat disheartened, and the Romans advance even 
to the Hall of the Wolfings. Then Thiodolf is led by the Hall-Sun, who personifies 
courage and duty, to the throne of the Wood-Sun, who confesses that, fearing his 
death and the end of their love on earth, she had fastened the hauberk upon him. 
Thereupon Thiodolf casts it away, and subordinating love to duty, he goes forth 
to meet a hero's death on the morrow's battlefield. The sight of the War-Duke, in 
his old strength and cheer, incites the " stark men and doughty warriors" to the 
complete undoing of the Romans. The day is given up to the chanting of dirges for 
the dead; and the night wears away in feasting. All the kindred hallow with song 
the return of the warriors "with victory in their hands." And thereafter the Wolfings "throve in field and fold." 

This fascinating story is pervaded with the charm of a primitive people, who live 
a picturesque life both in agriculture and on the battlefield. 

The style of the author, the quaint and simple English, molded frequently into a 
beautiful chant or song, makes 'The House of the Wolfings' a most artistic and 
attractive tale.</summary>

beginning when More is merely a private gentleman, a great lawyer, and friend of 
Erasmus, afterward introduces the reader to his life at court, and the prosperous 
days when he stood first in bluff King Hal's favor, and pathetically describes his 
downfall and tragic death. The record of the high-minded and cultivated Margaret 
presents a delightful picture of a lovely home life, and of the noble and accomplished 
gentleman who was its head and its inspiration. Her devotion to her father never 
wanes, even in the terrible hour when, after his execution, she "clasped in her last 
trance her murdered father's head." The simplicity and sincerity of the author's 
treatment give the book an air of reality, while its faithfulness to the tone of the period 
makes it more historical than history.</summary>

Twain"), was published in 1884. It is a sequel to, and follows the fortunes of, the 
leading characters of the same author's 'Tom Sawyer,' from which it differs in tone 
and construction, touching now and again upon vital social questions with an undertone of evidently serious interest. Like its predecessor, it is a story of boyhood for 
boys; but it is also a vital study of American life, the Odyssey of Adventure on the 
Mississippi. Many critics consider it Mark Twain's masterpiece. 

The story traces the wanderings of "Huck" and Tom, who have run away from 
iiome; and tells how, with their old friend the negro Jim, they proceed down the 
Mississippi, mainly on a raft. 

The boys pass through a series of experiences, now thrilling, now humorous; 
falling in with two ignorant but presumptuously clever sharpers, whose buffoonery, 
and efforts to escape justice and line their own pockets at the expense of the boys 
and the kindly but gullible folk whom they meet, form a series of the funniest episodes of the story. Tom's and Huck's return up the river puts an end to the anxiety 
of their friends, and to a remarkable series of adventures. 

The author draws from his intimate knowledge of the great river and the Southern 
country along its banks; and not only preserves to us a valuable record of a rapidly 
disappearing social order, but throws light upon some questions of moment to the 
student of history.</summary>
  <summary author="Butler, Samuel (1612-1680)" title="Hudibras" print_title="Hudibras">HUDIBRAS, by Samuel Butler, a satirical poem in eight-syllable couplets. The 
first part appeared in 1662, the second in 1664, and the third in 1678. Under the 
guise of a burlesque tale of knight-errantry the author heaps ridicule upon the Puritan 
party. Hudibras, the hero, a knight and justice of the peace who rides out in quest 
of adventure, represents the Presbyterians, and perhaps also Butler's former employer, Sir Samuel Luke, a colonel in Cromwell's army; Ralpho, the squire of Hudibras, typifies the Independents. After a long description of the two men, with 
emphasis on the militancy, metaphysical subtlety, and hypocrisy of the Presbyterians 
and the mysticism and fanaticism of the Independents, the poet tells of the attempt 
of Hudibras and Ralpho to break up a bear-baiting. Successful at first in placing one 
of the revellers, Crowdero, a fiddler, in the stocks, they are overcome by a counter-attack, led by Trulla, an Amazonian warrior, and themselves imprisoned. From this 
disgrace Hudibras is released by a wealthy widow, to whom he has paid his addresses, 
and who promises not only to loose him but also to many him if he will promise to 
give himself a whipping. Having made the pledge and having been set at liberty 
Hudibras now attempts to evade it by having the whipping done by proxy in the 
person of his squire. In a clever imitation of contemporary theological discussion he 
and Ralpho dispute on the legitimacy of this subterfuge, until they are interrupted by 
a second rustic gathering, occupied in punishing a scold and her henpecked husband. 
Attempting again to interfere Hudibras and his squire are pelted with filth and seek 
refuge in a horse-pond. Unwilling to endure anything further, even voluntarily 
inflicted, the knight now goes to an astrologer, Sidrophel, to inquire whether he is 
destined to win the widow or not. They fall to dispute, and the astrologer with his 
man, Wachum, are beaten by the knight. The poem is now brought to an end by 
three epistles, one from Hudibras to Sidrophel, one from Hudibras to the Widow, and 
the third giving the widow's reply. The story is of less importance than the brilliant 
and still-quoted epigrams with which it abounds and the clever travesties on the 
theological hair-splitting and hypocritical austerity of the Puritans in their prosperous 
days.</summary>

story is written in the form of an autobiography, and is told by Hugh Wynne, 
who later becomes Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel on the staff of his excellency, General 
Washington. The scene is laid in Philadelphia during the time of the Revolution, 
and a very truthful and striking picture is given of the social life and customs of the 
Quaker City. The hero, Hugh Wynne, is the son of a rigid old Philadelphia merchant
intolerant of youth and pleasure, as well as of armed resistance to authority, who in 
his youth had married a gay and loving French woman, the direct opposite of her 
stiff-necked husband. Hugh endures the austerities of his grim father as long as his 
ardent and strong-willed nature will allow, and when the moment arrives that he 
can be spared from a business which has never been congenial to him, he follows the 
leading of his heart to the camp of Washington and takes service with the patriotic 
forces. Being a good shot and an admirable swordsman he soon gets a commission, 
and from that time shares the hardships and successes of the campaign. At one time 
a prisoner in Philadelphia, at another a spy seeking out weak spots in the enemy's 
defence, and again on the staff of Lafayette, he participates in the most important 
scenes of the long and wavering struggle. Darthea Peniston, the love of Hugh's life, 
is a fascinating and lovely girl whose coquetry and charm wins for her the love of 
Jack Warder, Hugh's faithful and constant friend, and also that of Arthur Wynne, 
Hugh's cousin, the plausible villain of the story. Darthea, however, remains true 
to Hugh, and Warder nobly stifles his affection and proves himself the loyal and 
unselfish friend. The story is full of charm and interest and pictures the life of the 
old regime of Philadelphia with all the variety and grace, elegance and refinement 
which then belonged to it.</summary>
  <summary author="Hamerton, Philip Gilbert (1834-1894)" title="Human Intercourse" print_title="Human Intercourse">HUMAN INTERCOURSE, by Philip Gilbert Hamerton (1884), is a collection of 
essays on social relationships, opening with a short treatise on the difficulty of discovering fixed laws in this domain which all inhabit, which so few understand. The 
remaining essays treat of passionate love, of friendship, of filial duties and affections, 
r f priests and women, of differences of rank and wealth; in short, they cover nearly all 
divisions of the subject. The author brings to the consideration of his theme reasonableness and sympathy. In his essays on marriage and on love, especially, he shows 
a keen knowledge of human nature, and of the hidden springs of passion. It is his 
comprehension of passion, indeed, which makes possible his intelligence on other 
subjects related to human intercourse. The essays are well supplied with concrete 
examples from life, in illustration of the points in question. They are written in 
everyday forcible English, well fitted to the subject-matter.</summary>
  <summary author="Smollett, T. (Tobias) (1721-1771)" title="Humphry Clinker" print_title="Humphry Clinker">HUMPHRY CLINKER, a novel in epistolary form by Tobias George Smollett was 
published in 1771. It records in a series of letters the adventures of a family party 
traveling in England and Scotland. The household consists of Matthew Bramble of 
Brambleton Hall in Wales, an eccentric and valetudinarian bachelor; his sister, 
Tabitha, a foolish old maid; their nephew, Jerry Melford, a Cambridge student; their 
niece, Lydia Alelford, just out of boarding-school; Winifred Jenkins, the maid, whose 
spelling is fearful and wonderful; and Humphry Clinker the coachman, a poor, 
ragged ostler picked up en route, and taken into service by the benevolent Mr. 
Bramble in place of another man, Thomas, who has been dismissed. The journey 
begins at Gloucester, where Lydia has been at boarding-school and where her brother 
discovers that she is corresponding with a good-looking young actor who calls himself 
Wilson. A duel between the two men having been averted the party proceeds to 
Bath. A lively and interesting picture of the frivolities and absurdities of this 
famous watering-place and health-resort is presented from various points of view in 
the different letters written from here. A visit to London introduces us to Ranelagh 
and Vauxhall, the wits and the politicians. Humphry Clinker turns Methodist 
preacher, and is imprisoned for a time on a false charge of robbery. The route then 
turns northward through Yorkshire. At Durham the party is joined by an odd-looking Scottish soldier Lieutenant Obadiah Lismahago, who entertains them with a 
blood-curdling story of the cruelties he suffered as a captive of the Indians, and wins 
the favor of Tabitha Bramble. The most interesting description, however, is that of 
Scotland, the peculiarities of which country are vividly set forth. In the end Lydia's 
suitor, who has appeared on various disguises at different stages of the journey, 
proves to be one George Dennison, a gentleman of rank and wealth, who was masquerading as an actor to avoid an unwelcome marriage forced on him by his parents. He 
marries Lydia Melford. Tabitha is united to Lismahago. Humphry Clinker turns 
out to be a natural son of Matthew Bramble, and is happily married to Winifred 
Jenkins. In spite of its occasional coarseness of expression and its brutal realism the 
book is a highly entertaining picture of British society in the eighteenth century. It 
contains some definitely characterized personages, and the plot is sufficiently marked 
to arouse the reader's interest. The epistolary form is not tedious, for each letter 
sets the facts in a new light by reflecting them through a different personality.</summary>
  <summary author="Kingsley, Charles (1819-1875)" title="Hypatia" print_title="Hypatia">HYPATIA, by Charles Kingsley (1838). This famous romance presents a stirring 
picture of the fifth century of the Christian era, against the background of the learned 
city of Alexandria in Egypt. A young Christian monk, Philammon, a denizen of the 
rock monasteries on the Upper Nile, moved by a burning desire to save his fellowmen 
from sin and destruction, makes his abode in Alexandria. There his sleeping senses 
are aroused by the magnificent pageant of the decaying Roman world. His mystical 
visions vanish in the garish light of a too brilliant intellectuality. Greek culture, 
Roman order, the splendid certainties of the pagan world, fascinate a mind "half 
sick of shadows.' 1 Yet he is drawn to what is best in the old order. Its noble philosophy, its sane ideals, its fine temperance, seem embodied in Hypatia, a beautiful 
woman over whom ancient Greece exercises an all-potent fascination. In her 
lecture-room she expounds principles of religious philosophy, the fruit of a younger, 
purer, and brighter civilization. To Philammon she makes her appeal, as a woman 
and as a guiding intellect. Jealousy of her influence is however rife in Alexandria 
among the followers of the bishop Cyril, one of the arch-fanatics of history. Greek 
intelligence is brought face to face with mediaeval blindness. The temper of the 
proselytizer conquers, because the Zeitgeist is in its favor, while the Greek philosophy 
belongs to a dead age. The infuriated Christians fall upon Hypatia in her lecture-room, and tear her limb from limb. The book closes upon the conquerors each "going 
to his own place," and upon world-weary Alexandria settling down to its everlasting 
sleep. 

'Hypatia' abounds in brilliant descriptions of the strange life of the period, with 
its opalescent colors of decay. It does full justice to the Christians of the fifth century 
to whom the urbanity of the earlier church was foreign. Its most beautiful picture is 
of the woman Hypatia, seeking the white light of old Greece through the intervening 
mists stained with the thought and passion of well-nigh a thousand years.</summary>
  <summary author="Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth (1807-1882)" title="Hyperion" print_title="Hyperion">HYPERION, by H. W. Longfellow (1839). 'Hyperion, The Wanderer on High'
is a fitting title for this, the most romantic of Longfellow's works. It frankly declares 
itself 'A Romance,' on the title-page. 

It is the tale of a young man in deepest sorrow, wandering from land to land in 
search of occupation for his mind, and forgetfulness of grief. This motive forms the 
thread of story which connects a series of philosophical discourses, and romantic 
legends and poems. Many of these last are Longfellow's translations of German 
poems; and they have found a place in his collected poems. The adventures and 
wanderings of the hero portray the experiences and travels of the author on his second 
trip through Germany and Switzerland after the death of his wife. Immediately 
after its publication, 'Hyperion' had a wide circulation. 

This book more than any other brought on Longfellow the reproach of being 
more foreign than American in his sympathies. Yet it had great value in creating 
in this country a more extensive acquaintance with the German romantic poets.

'Hyperion' also has historic interest in marking the transition in Longfellow's 
work. It stands between his translations and sketches of historical persons and 
places, and his original poems.</summary>
  <summary author="Huneker, James (1857-1921)" title="Iconoclasts A Book of Dramatists" print_title="Iconoclasts\nA Book of Dramatists">ICONOCLASTS; 'A Book of Dramatists' by James Huneker, is a series of 
dramatic essays which first appeared in the New York Sun and were collected in this 
volume in 1905. The authors discussed are Ibsen (who occupies nearly a third of the 
book), Strindberg, Becque, Hauptmann, Sudermann, Hervieu, Gorky, D'Annunzio, 
Maeterlinck, Villiers  Adam, Princess Mathilde, and George Bernard Shaw. 
The general resemblance between these modern dramatists is, first, that they have 
broken the standards of formal art and given their creative instincts an outlet in 
accordance with their own aesthetic impulses; and secondly, that they are dominated 
by symbolism. The author has an intimate acquaintance with modern tendencies
in art, and a brilliant and facile pen. His constant application of musical terms to 
literary exposition is sometimes suggestive but often irritating; and in the attempt to 
be epigrammatic he occasionally becomes affected. His analysis of modern dramatic 
thought and form is, however, of value to the student of present-day literature.</summary>
  <summary author="Dostoyevsky, Fyodor (1821-1881)" title="The Idiot" print_title="The Idiot">IDIOT, THE, by F. M. Dostoyevsky (1868). Prince Myshkin, the hero, is an epilep^ 
tic, whose secluded invalid life has apparently destroyed the faults of the mind, the 
sins of egotism, ambition, pride, and deceit, and left him the wise fool of lovely simple 
childlike character who wins all hearts. He returns to St. Petersburg to a mad 
chaotic world of villains and egoists, a corrupt and frivolous society, which laughs at 
his sincerity and innocence, but cannot escape his gentle influence. The reckless 
beautiful Nastasia loves him, and Aglaia, a young society girl, becomes engaged to him. 
The jealousy of the two women is incomprehensible to his simple nature. He radiates 
love and goodwill to both, and finally breaks his engagement to Aglaia to save Nastasia from the passionate violent merchant Rogozhin. On the wedding day, the 
impulsive Xastasia leaves him knowing his love is only pity and goes to Rogozhin, 
whom she hates. The jealous Rogozhin marries her and kills her. Prince Myshkin 's 
exquisitely sensitive spirit cannot survive the horror of the night with the murderer 
in the room where she is lying dead, and he becomes in fact what he has often been 
called an "idiot." The character of Prince Myshkin is revealed in conversations in 
which he expresses the sweetness of his nature, his sympathy with the unfortunate and 
his understanding and love for children. He says, "What has always surprised me was
the false idea that grown-up people have of children. They are not even understood 
by their fathers and mothers. We ought to conceal nothing from children under the 
pretext that they are little and that at their age they should remain ignorant of 
certain things. What a sad and unfortunate idea! And how clearly the children 
themselves perceive that their parents take them for babies who can't understand 
anything, when really they understand even-thing." His kindness to those who try 
to exploit him and his humility enrages Aglaia. She exclaims: "There isn't a person 
who deserves such words from you! here not one of them is worth your little finger, 
not one who has your intelligence or your heart 1 You are more honest than all of us, 
more noble than all, better than all, more clever than all! There isn't one of these 
people who is fit to pick up the handkerchief you let fall, so why then do you humiliate 
yourself and place yourself below everybody! Why have you crushed yourself, why 
haven't you any pride?" In the "Idiot" Dostoyevsky has drawn his own ideal of a 
Christlike character. He was himself subject to epilepsy.</summary>
  <summary author="Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson, Baron (1809-1892)" title="Idylls of the King" print_title="Idylls of the King">IDYLLS OF THE KING, THE, by Alfred Tennyson, a series of twelve narrative 
episodes in the epic manner (completed 1885), the whole forming a unified epic of 
King Arthur, though without the structural continuity of the formal epic and therefore called by the author 'Idylls' that is pictures or scenes. Tennyson's principal 
sources were Malory's 'Morte D'Arthur,' Layamon's 'Brut,' Geoffrey of Monmouth's 
'Chronicle,' and Lady Guest's translation of the Welsh 'Mabinogion.' These he 
handled freely, in accordance with the more finished and concentrated effect that he 
wished to produce and the ideas that he wished allegorically to embody. The poem 
sets forth the reign of King Arthur, from his supernatural coming, through his 
conquests and beneficent reign, to his fall and supernatural departure. Under the 
whole story is an allegorical meaning. Arthur is the soul struggling with the flesh 
or the temptations of the world, which are represented by his enemies and later by 
the worldly and corrupt among his knights. He is also the ideal knight and king
contrasted with the less perfect though more human types, Lancelot, Gawain, and 
the rest. The poem developed gradually, and the twelve idylls were not written 
according to the chronological sequence of the story. 'The Passing of Arthur' which 
concludes the Idylls, was in part the first written, its principal episode having appeared under this title in the volume of Tennyson's poems published in 1842. The 
next idylls to be published were 'Enid 1 (afterwards divided into 'The Marriage of 
Geraint 1 and 'Geraint and Enid'), 'Vivien' (later 'Merlin and Vivien'), 'Elaine' 
(later 'Lancelot and Elaine'), and 'Guinevere' (1859). 'The Coming of Arthur,' 
'The Holy Grail/ 'Pelleas and Etarre' and the completed 'Passing of Arthur' 
appeared in 1869; and the three additional phases of the story were furnished by 
'The Last Tournament' (1871); 'Gareth and Lynette' (1872), and 'Balin and Balan' 
(1885) . To summarize briefly the completed poem, ' The Coming of Arthur ' narrates 
Arthur's mysterious origin, his winning of the kingdom of Britain by Merlin's assistance, his achievement of Guinevere as his bride, and his twelve great victories over 
the Saxons. This Idyll and the ensuing, ' Gareth and L}Taette/ an attractive tale of 
a youthful knight winning a lady through humility towards her and valor against 
gigantic opponents, are characterized by a spirit of hope and confidence born of the 
high ideals and practical resolutions of a loyal and united court. 'The Marriage of 
Geraint' and 'Geraint and Enid' based on the Welsh Mabinogion, tell a romantic 
tale of a brave young knight rescuing and wedding a youthful beauty and of the 
wifely heroism and devotion of this same beauty when her husband put her to an 
undeserved test. In these two Idylls we first hear the rumor of guilty love between 
Lancelot and Queen Guinevere a disloyalty destined to corrupt and disunite the 
whole realm. 'Balin and Balan' shows the first disastrous effects of this poison. 
The rumor of Guinevere's guilt, skilfully fanned by the malignant Vivien, mistress of 
Arthur's rival, Mark of Cornwall, so maddens Balin the Savage, who worships the 
queen, that he insults her colors and fights with his brother, Balan, a duel in which 
both are slain. In 'Merlin and Vivien,' the woman responsible for the brother's 
death comes to Arthur's court, blackens its reputation by spreading the foulest 
scandal, and at length captivates by her flatteries the mage, Merlin, whom she imprisons in a hollow oak by a charm that he has taught her. In 'Lancelot and Elaine' 
the relations of Guinevere and Lancelot are becoming more widely known and their 
sense of sin is manifested in their bickerings with one another. Yet Lancelot puts 
aside the pure love of Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat, and remains "falsely true" to 
the queen. In 'The Holy Grail,' to quote the note by Hallam, Lord Tennyson "In 
some, as faith declines, religion turns from practical goodness and holiness to superstition." The knights ride out in quest of the vision of the Holy Grail, which a few 
of their number have the spiritual gift to see. Three of these, Galahad, Percival, and 
Bors, attain the vision and retire from the world to the life of contemplation. The 
remainder, having no vocation, abandon the quest and many perish of misadventure. 
Lancelot fails to see the Grail because he will not abandon his love of Guinevere. 
'Pelleas and Etarre' and 'The Last Tournament' show the gradual disintegration of 
the Table Round. The court is growing more cynical; the relations of Lancelot and 
Guinevere are known to all but the King; Etarre shamelessly flings aside the devotion 
of young Pelleas for the light-of-love, Gawain; Tristram, lover of Isote, King Mark's 
wife, openly proclaims infidelity to her and scoffs at all bonds of loyalty and affection 
('The Last Tournament'). In 'Guinevere' the love of Lancelot and the Queen is 
reported to King Arthur by' his nephew," Modred, and Vivien. The lovers flee and 
part, Lancelot for his realms overseas, Guinevere to the convent of Almesbury. Here 
Arthur, on his way to fight with Modred, now in rebellion, rebukes her, forgives her,
and bids her farewell. 'The Passing of Arthur* describes his last battle, his mortal 
wound at the hands of Modred, and his departure to the supernatural world from 
whence he came. Although the character of Arthur is too blameless to win perfect 
sympathy the poem is not obtrusively didactic and the allegorical meaning is so subordinated and softened as to avoid inartistic prominence. The love-story of Lancelot 
and Guinevere is told with dramatic insight and human sympathy which is never 
sentimentalized into approval; the subordinate characters and the mediaeval incidents and backgrounds are depicted in soft, brilliant colors; and the blank verse and 
lyrics mingle smoothness and strength. The poem is a thoroughly adequate handling 
of a great epic theme which had long awaited modern poetical treatment. </summary>
  <summary author="Homer (-750--650)" title="The Iliad of Homer" print_title="The Iliad of Homer">ILIAD, THE, an epic poem in Greek hexameters, existent as early as 1100-900 B. C. 
handed down by the rhapsodes or public reciters and reduced to writing about the 
time of Pisistratus. The poem was for ages attributed to Homer, said to have been 
a blind singer of one of the Greek cities of Asia Minor or one of the islands of the 
^Egean. At the close of the eighteenth century the theory was promulgated that 
Homer was either a myth or a figure of slight importance and that the Iliad was 
simply a compilation of various heroic lays of the siege of Troy. Most modern 
scholars, realizing the unity of the poem both in structure and in spirit, reject this 
hypothesis and hold that the Iliad is the creation of one directing intellect; but it is 
admitted that we have no certain knowledge about the author and that earlier lays, 
more or less modified, must have been incorporated by him into the structure of his 
great work. The theme of the poem is the wrath of Achilles against Agamemnon and 
its results. Indignant at Agamemnon, leader of the expedition against Troy, because 
he has seized Briseis, a captive maiden awarded to Achilles, the latter refuses to take 
part in the siege of Troy. As a result of his withdrawal the war goes badly for the 
Greeks. At their urgent request Achilles allows his friend, Patroclus, to put on his 
armor and fight in his place. Patroclus, however, is killed by Hector, the bravest of 
the Trojans. Maddened by his loss, Achilles obtains new armor from his goddess-mother, Thetis, executes great slaughter upon the Trojans, and kills Hector. To 
prolong his vengeance he drags the body around the walls of Troy at the wheels of his 
chariot; but through the intercession of Hector's father, Priam, the King of Troy, he 
yields up the body to the old man. This simple story is elaborated by full and 
particular accounts of the various battles, embassies, and feasts; by the intervention 
of the gods at numerous points in the story; and by such episodes as the exploits of 
Diomedes, and the funeral games of Patroclus. The unity of this great and diversified 
poem, the passionate intensity of its central theme, the marvellous ease, flexibility, and 
dignified simplicity of its style, and its vivid portrayal of the heroic age of Greece 
are some of the reasons of its greatness. The most famous English translations are 
Chapman's (1598-1611) in the long "fourteener" couplet, Pope's (1715-1725) in 
heroic couplets, Cowper's (1791) in blank verse, Lord Derby's (1867) in blank verse, 
William Cullen Bryant's (1870) in blank verse, Andrew Lang, Walter Leaf, and 
Ernest Myer's translation into archaic prose (1882), F. W. Newman's translation 
(1856) in unrhymed "fourteener's" famous because it elicited Matthew Arnold's 
'On Translating Homer', A. S. Way's translation (1886), Samuel Butler's prose 
version (1916).</summary>
  <summary author="Oppenheim, E. Phillips (Edward Phillips) (1866-1946)" title="The Illustrious Prince" print_title="The Illustrious Prince">ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE, THE, by E. Phillips Oppenheim (1910). This story opens 
with the mysterious murder of an American named Hamilton Tynes; the deed is 
perpetrated on a special train which he has chartered to convey him from Liverpool
to London and as he is the only passenger, and his identity unknown, the tragedy is 
inexplicable. The following night Richard Vanderpool, a young American attache of 
the Legation, is murdered in a taxi which is taking him to the theatre to join a party of 
friends. Subsequent events show that both murdered men were carrying important 
papers, which were being conveyed from the American to the English Government, 
and which contained confidential information relating to affairs in Japan. Suspicion 
centers on a charming Japanese prince, Maiyo by name, who is living temporarily in 
London in great magnificence and who is much sought after socially. No clues to 
the murderer can be found except the slender Japanese dagger with which Tynes was 
stabbed and the silken cord with which Vanderpool had been strangled. Prince 
Maiyo, who is most courtly in manner and attractive in every way is a great favorite 
with the ladies and among these Penelope Morse, a beautiful American girl, is especially attracted to him. Although suspecting the Prince of the crime, his charm 
is so great that when she is in his presence his strong personality conquers her distrust. 
The Prince invites his friends to visit his house and inspect his art treasures and 
Penelope noticing a curiously wrought casket asks the Prince to unlock it for her. 
He does so and Penelope putting her hand into its hidden recesses draws out a dagger 
and a silken cord identical with those used by the murderer. A glance into the Prince's 
face tells her the truth and she is filled with horror at her discovery. Feeling it her 
duty to make her discovery known, she informs the American minister, who is a 
personal friend, and he notifies the inspectors who have already secured other evidence. The prince, whose crime has been committed for the good of his country 
and not for any advantage to himself, is arrested and is about to give himself into the 
hands of the law when his devoted servant Soto, who bears a strong resemblance to 
Maiyo, rushes in and declaring himself the murderer takes poison and dies, thereby 
saving the life of his beloved master. The Prince's work being accomplished he 
returns to his own country and Penelope marries a young English lord, named Sir 
Charles Somerby.</summary>
  <summary author="Thomas, à Kempis (1380-1471)" title="The Imitation of Christ" print_title="The Imitation of Christ">IMITATION OF CHRIST, THE, attributed to Thomas a Kempis, a book of religious 
meditations originally written in Latin between 1417 and 1421, and subsequently 
translated into various languages. Next to the Bible it is the most widely-read
Christian book of devotion. The author was probably Thomas Hammerken, a 
native of Kempen in Rhenish Prussia, afterwards priest and monk of the monastery 
of Agnetenberg near Zwolle in Holland. In a series of aphorisms, grouped under 
related headings into chapters and books, he inculcates submission to the divine will 
the subduing of the lower instincts and of the impulse to self-gratification, and the 
endeavor to conform ourselves to the model of Christ's goodness. Though ascetic 
and other-worldly in point of view, the author puts strong emphasis on the need 
of practical goodness, and lays down sound rules for moral cultivation. He is 
shrewd, clear-sighted, and discriminating in his analysis of faults and his indication of remedies; and he invests the spiritual life with a charm and an appeal 
which remind us of the Gospel discourses themselves. The fourth and last book 
is a manual for the instruction and guidance of those preparing for the Communion; the fervor and devotional insight of its prayers and counsels are of high 
religious value. Matthew Arnold calls the 'Imitation' "the most exquisite document after those of the New Testament, of all that the Christian spirit has ever 
inspired."</summary>
  <summary author="Storm, Theodor (1817-1888)" title="Immensee" print_title="Immensee">IMMENSEE ('Bee Lake'), by Theodor Storm, a charming and idyllic Novelle or 
short story published in 1850. In a series of slightly-connected word-pictures the 
author tells a pathetic story of thwarted love and life-long regret. Reinhardt and 
Elizabeth live on two neighboring estates in a delightful country region near the 
beautiful wooded Immensee or Lake of Bees. They have the same tutor, spend their 
playtime together, and are entirely congenial playmates. Reinhardt has a gift for 
telling stories and often entertains Elizabeth with fairy-tales and later with verses. 
One day when the children are in their teens they lose their way in the woods beside 
the Immensee while hunting for strawberries for a picnic meal. As they sit resting in 
the woods (the charm of which is exquisitely described) Reinhardt seeing Elizabeth 
in the midst of this beauty comes half-consciously to realize that for him she is the 
center of it all. Soon afterwards we find him at the university, recalled from a 
student kneipe and the fascinations of a gypsy dancer by news of a Christmas 
package from home which he goes off to open. He finds a letter from Elizabeth, the 
freshened recollection of whom turns his thoughts to purer and simpler channels. 
On his vacation he finds Elizabeth on the threshold of womanhood, and the relations 
between them pass from those of boy and girl to those of potential lovers. They 
botanize together, and he presents her with some of his verses, all of which center 
in her; but he does not venture as yet to tell her of his love, although he speaks of a 
secret which he will reveal when he returns from the University two years hence. 
After his departure Elizabeth is persistently wooed by a friend of Reinhardt's, Erich, 
a young man of wealth, decision, and practicality. In the absence of the dreamier 
Reinhardt he at length succeeds, with the aid of her mother, in persuading Elizabeth 
to marry him. The news reaches Reinhardt at the University. Some years later he 
visits Erich and his wife at their fine new estate on the banks of Immensee, where in 
reading his poetry and revisiting the scenes of their past happiness he gives an unobtrusive expression to his regret, in which Elizabeth evidently shares. After a short 
visit Reinhardt bids Elizabeth farewell and leaves in the night. At the end as at the 
beginning of the story he is an old man, dreaming of this lost love of his youth. The 
artistic brevity and restraint of the book and its truthfulness and sincerity redeem it 
from every trace of sentimentality. It is an attractive study of the dreamy side of the 
German character, and is filled with beauty of landscape endeared by human associations and habitation.</summary>
  <summary author="Daudet, Alphonse (1840-1897)" title="The Immortal" print_title="The Immortal">IMMORTAL, THE, by Alphonse Daudet (1888). "L'Immortel" is the last noted 
work of the late distinguished French critic, dramatist, and novelist, Alphonse 
Daudet. It professes to be a description of mosurs parisiennes, but is really a satire 
on the pretensions of the French Academy; its title, 'The Immortal,' being the 
epithet popularly applied to the forty members of that exclusive and self -perpetuating 
body. Daudet himself, although his novel 'Fromont Jeune et Risler Ame' was 
crowned by the Academy with the Jouy prize, was never elected to its membership 
and with the brothers Goncourt, Zola, and others, he formed a rival literary clique. 
The satirical thrusts in 'The Immortal' were keenly felt and resented by the Academicians. Apart from this personal connection, 'L'Immortel' cannot be said to vie 
in interest or merit with the celebrated tales of the 'Tartarins,' or with 'Numa 
Roumestan,' 'Kings in Exile,' or 'Sappho.' The hero of the story is a bookworm, an 
Academician whose works have been successively "crowned by the Academy" until 
its crowns were exhausted, and nothing remained but to elect him to membership. 
Meanwhile he has been employed by the government as Archivist of Foreign Affairs; 
but an unhappy expression introduced in the history of the house of Orleans,  Then 
as to-day, France, "submerged under the wave of demagogism," gave such offense 
to the government that it cost him his position, his salary, and his livelihood. He 
now devotes himself to the editing of certain MSS. of untold value, which have come 
into his possession, and his hopes and ambitions hang upon the delight with which the 
world will welcome these treasures. Treated by his ambitious wife and spendthrift 
son with ironical contempt and heartless neglect, his misfortunes are crowned by the 
revelation that his prized archaeological documents are forgeries; and that the Academy, indignant at the disgrace thus brought upon it, is discussing his degradation 
among the "mortals." Ridiculed by all Paris, and berated at home by his angry and 
disappointed wife, "the perpetual secretary of the Academy," finding neither solace 
nor protection in its shelter in this hour of his dire need, ends his troubles by throwing 
himself into the Seine.</summary>
  <summary author="Booth, William (1829-1912)" title="In Darkest England, and the Way Out" print_title="In Darkest England,\nand the Way Out">IN DARKEST ENGLAND AND THE WAY OUT, by William Booth (1890), general 
of the Salvation Army. This book, whose title was evidently suggested by Stanley's 
'Darkest Africa.' treats of the want, misery, and vice, which cling like barnacles to 
the base of English society, as they do the base of all old civilizations, and which 
it is so much easier to shut one's eyes upon than to analyze, explain, and remedy. 
General Booth's opportunities for knowing whereof he speaks were exceptionally 
good. The statements he makes are appalling, but they are supported by figures and 
facts. The subject of his book is the temporal and spiritual rescue of "a population 
about equal to that of Scotland. Three million men, women, and children . . . 
nominally free, but really enslaved," what he calls "the submerged tenth." The 
plan he proposes seems practical and practicable, one indeed in the execution of 
which he has made some progress since the appearance of his book. The plan contemplates the establishment in the great centres of population of "city colonies" 
(establishments at which the destitute may be provided for, the temporarily unemployed given work, etc.); those for whom such a course seems best being passed 
on to the self-supporting " farm colony," which in turn contributes to English or 
other colonies or to the "colony over sea" (yet to be founded). The result 
would be a segregation of the needy into localities where they could be handled, 
with a draining off to unreaped fields, as this process became desirable, of a 
part of the great army of occupation. This book is the work of a man in deadly 
earnest, who feels himself to be an instrument in the hands of God for the rescue 
of the lost. </summary>
  <summary author="Gissing, George (1857-1903)" title="In the Year of Jubilee" print_title="In the Year\nof Jubilee">IN THE YEAR OF JUBILEE, by George Gissing (1895). Gissing's realism is 
relentless; and his tale of middle-class philistinism would be unbearable were it not 
also the story of the growth of a soul through suffering. Nancy Lord, the heroine, 
daughter of a piano-dealer in a small way, has in her the elements of strength which 
under other circumstances would have made her silent and rigid father great. Her 
youth is full of mistakes, the tests of life are all too severe for her, and she seems to 
have met total defeat before her "fighting soul" sets itself to win. Perhaps it is not 
a very great victory to turn a foolish and compulsory marriage into a calm and 
comfortable modus vivendi. But it is great to her. Besides the vivid and headlong 
Nancy, and her faithful friend and servant Alary Woodruffe, there is hardly a personage in the book whose acquaintance the reader would voluntarily make. Even 
the hero, a gentleman by birth and tradition, seems rather a plated article than "the 
real thing," though he shows signs of grace as the story ends. All the women are 
sordid, mean, half -educated under a process which is mentally superficial and morally 
non-existent. The men are petty, or vulgar, or both. Apparently both men and 
women, typical as they are, and carefully studied, are meant to show the mischief 
that may be done by imposing on the commonest mentality a system of instruction 
fit only for brains with inherited tendencies towards culture. Yet the book is not a 
problem work. It is a picture of the cheaper commercial London and the race it 
develops; and it is so interesting a human document that the expostulating reader 
is forced to go on to the end.</summary>
  <summary author="Reuter, Fritz (1810-1874)" title="In the Year 13" print_title="In the Year 13">IN THE YEAR 13, 'Ut de Franzosentid' (1860), is a translation from the Low Dutch 
of Fritz Reuter, by Charles Lee Lewis ( 1867). It is one of a series to which Reuter gave 
the general name 'Old Camomile Flowers,' signifying "old tales useful as homely 
remedies." The delightfully homely narration of life in a Dutch village the prim
orderly ways of the women, the petty issues brought before the patriarchal 
Amtshauptmann, and the general confusion resulting from the side issues of war 
is both pathetic and humorous. The scene is laid in Reuter's native town of Stavenhagen; and the characters are real people, whose real names are preserved. The 
story is an animated presentation of the state of feeling prevailing among a people 
who detested yet feared Napoleon, and were forced to treat the French as allies while 
regarding them as bitterest enemies. A party of "rascally French" chasseurs throw 
the town into tumult, and finally ride off with several captives unjustly accused of 
theft. Before these are released come many adventures, quarrels, and a fierce pursuit 
of unlawful booty, through which runs an idyllic love story, that of Miller Voss's 
beautiful daughter Fieka. Back of all the somewhat slow and simple-minded Dutch 
folk looms the invisible yet dominant presence of Napoleon, as a force which they are 
always conscious of and always dreading.</summary>

Captain A. T. Mahan, U.S.N. (1890). The influence of sea-power on defeat 
and victory had been neglected by historians, and Captain Mahan wrote this 
book in order to point out its high importance. After showing conclusively that the 
Roman defeat of Carthage in the second Punic war was in large part due to Roman
superiority in the Mediterranean and after analyzing the elements of sea-power 
he proceeds to trace the naval history of Europe from 1660 to 1812, giving a delightfully clear and accurate account of the principal naval battles and campaigns and 
introducing discussions of strategical and tactical problems involved, for which he 
draws on his own experience of active service. In this narrative he never loses sight 
of his thesis that the command of the sea spells success, and is quick to find illustrations of it. A cruiser-war on the enemy's commerce by a nation of inferior naval 
power will not bring victory, though many instances are pointed out in which it was 
tried. A leading practical aim of the book was to rouse the United States to the need 
of a powerful navy as a defense against possible aggression from a European power 
and as a protection to the mercantile marine, which he believed she was destined to 
develop. This history is scholarly, just, entertaining in style, original in its ideas, 
and persuasive in their presentation. </summary>

Eveleth returns alone from a round of social festivities in Paris to find her mother-in-law, who fears some impending tragedy, awaiting her in the palatial Paris residence. 
A telephone message shortly announces that George Eveleth has been killed in a duel, 
fought with the Marquis de Bienville in order to avenge the false accusations. made 
by the latter against his wife. Diane, who has been merely a reckless coquette, has 
led her husband into great extravagance and at his death finds herself face to face 
with poverty, as well as the reproaches of Mrs. Eveleth senior. The repentant widow 
secretly transfers her remaining patrimony to her mother-in-law and the two women 
sail for New York, where the elder woman has relatives. Here Diane encounters 
Derek Pruyn, a widower, whom she has known and admired in early years, and is 
offered the situation of chaperone for his daughter Dorothea, a headstrong young 
woman in need of feminine guidance. After a year in Pruyn's household, during which 
time Diane holds aloof from Pruyn's increasing devotion, he makes her an offer of 
marriage; she withholds her answer until his return from a voyage to South America, 
when she is prepared to accept him, but on his home-coming she finds his attitude 
towards her completely changed. Pruyn has encountered de Bienville on his voyage 
and has heard from him a recital of the charge that Diane was unfaithful to her 
husband. Pruyn denounces Diane's perfidy and she being too proud to defend herself 
at once takes leave of him." Subsequently Pruyn's highhanded methods cause Dorothea to plan an elopement which is successfully frustrated by Diane to whom the 
grateful father now turns again in love and gratitude; he renews his suit begging her 
to marry him no matter what her past may have been, but she indignantly refuses to 
wed one who could want her while believing in her previous guilt. In the end de 
Bienville confesses the falseness of his charges and clears Diane's reputation of the

of highly original humor this world-read book records a pleasure excursion on the 
Quaker City to Europe, the Holy Land, and Egypt, in the sixties. Descriptions of 
real events and the peoples and lands visited are enlivened by more or less fictitious 
dialogue and adventures. These, while absurdly amusing, always suggest the truth, 
stripped of hypocrisy and cant, as to how the reader "would be likely to see Europe 
and the East if he looked at them sincerely with his own eyes and without reverence 
for the past." The side- wheel steamer Quaker City carried the now famous excursionists across from New York touching at the Azores, described in a few rapid but 
wonderfully vivid strokes and from important port to port on the other side; and 
waited for them during several of their inland journeys. Returning, they touched at 
Gibraltar, Madeira, and the Bermudas. As to the advertised "select" quality of the 
voyagers, a characteristic paragraph states: "Henry Ward Beecher was to have 
accompanied the expedition, but urgent duties obliged him to give up the idea. 
There were other passengers who might have been spared better, and would have 
been spared more willingly. Lieutenant-General Sherman was to have been one of 
the party also, but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains. A popular 
actress had entered her name on the ship's books, but something interfered, and she

A. T. Mahan (1897). A work of significance because of the author's idea of "an 
approaching change in the thoughts and policy of Americans as to their relations 
with the world outside their own borders." The age of "home markets for home 
products" has about closed, in Captain Mahan's view, and the United States must 
consider interests reaching to all parts of the world. Although, therefore, his volume 
consists only of a collection of detached papers, and he makes no attempt to recast 
them into a continuous work, he yet puts over them a broadly significant title, and 
offers them to the reader as studies of a great theme. They are in that view of particular interest.</summary>
  <summary author="Euripides" title="Iphigenia" print_title="Iphigenia">IPHIGENIA, a drama, by Euripides (407 B.C.). The third and latest, and altogether 
the most modern, of the great masters of Greek drama, twice used the Iphigenia 
story, once in the fine masterpiece which was represented during his life, and 
again in a drama brought out after his death. The latter represented the time and 
scene of the bringing of the heroine to the altar of sacrifice, and the climax of the 
play was her readiness to accept a divine behest by giving up her life. The other and 
the finer play represented a time twenty years later. It told how she was snatched 
from under the knife of sacrifice by Divine intervention, and carried away to the 
land of the Tauri (where is now the Crimea), to live in honor as a priestess of Artemis, 
a feature of whose Taurian worship was the sacrificial immolation of any luckless 
strangers cast on shore by shipwreck. Twenty years had passed, and the Greek 
passion of Iphigenia to return to her own land, to at least hear of her people, was at its 
height, when two strangers from a wreck were taken, and it was her duty to preside 
at their sacrifice. They were Orestes and Pylades, the former her own brother. 
The climax of the play is in her recognition of Orestes, and in the means employed 
by her for her own and their escape. A singularly fine soliloquy of Iphigenia, upon 
hearing of the capture of two strangers, is followed by a dialogue between her and 
Orestes, unsurpassed, if not unequaled, by anything in Greek dramatic poetry. Her 
proposal to spare one to be the bearer of a letter to her Greek home, brings on a 
contest of self-devotion between Orestes and Pylades of wonderful dramatic power. 
The whole play shows Euripides at his best in ingenuity of construction and depth 
of feeling; and all the odes of the play are marked by extreme lyrical beauty? A 
notable one among them is the final one on the establishment of the worship of 
Apollo at Delphi. 

A celebrated parallel to the 'Iphigenia' of Euripides "was conceived and executed 
by Goethe. It is not properly an imitation. Although using scenery and characters 
nominally Greek, it is a thoroughly modern play, on lines of thought and sentiment 
quite other than Greek, and with a diction very unlike Greek. Of this modern kind 
it is a drama of the highest merit, a splendid example of modern psychological dramatic composition.</summary>

when her adopted son David is ten years old and she is living with him in the manufacturing town of Mercer, situated but a short distance from Old Chester. David 
has three playmates of his own age: Elizabeth Ferguson, a fascinating and passionate 
child, who lives with her bachelor uncle, and Blair and Nannie Maitland, whose 
mother is known as the "Iron Woman." Sarah Maitland is a woman of eccentric 
habits and masculine style. She manages the Maitland Iron Works which she has 
inherited from her husband, who only survived his marriage to her by a few months, 
and who died before the birth of Blair. Nannie, the child by a previous marriage, 
is a gentle and timid girl devoted to her stepbrother. The children grow up and 
Elizabeth after having a youthful affair with Blair, becomes engaged to David who 
is studying to be a doctor. A misunderstanding arises between them and Elizabeth,
in a burst of wild passion, marries Blair who is so much in love with her that he is 
willing to be false to his old friend. Mrs. Maitland, whose rough exterior hides an 
honest and affectionate nature, is overwhelmed by the dishonorable action of her son, 
whom she has idolized, and at once disinherits him. Blair whose artistic nature has 
been so shocked and repulsed by his mother's eccentricities that he has no real affection for her, is furious, and severs all connection with her. An explosion occurs at 
the works, and Sarah Maitland is fatally hurt. Before her death she writes the name 
of Blair upon a check for a large sum of money which she had planned to give David 
for building a hospital. She is unable to sign the check and Nannie who is the only 
one present, anxious that Blair shall have the money, forges her mother's name after 
her death. Blair is gratified with the bequest and is preparing to invest it when the 
truth becomes known. Elizabeth, who has always loved David, asks Blair to give 
him the money and when he declines to do so, leaves him and goes to David. David, 
who has continued to love Elizabeth passionately, urges her to flee with him, and 
she is ready to do so when Helena Ritchie appears upon the scene and prevents the 
action by confessing to them her own experience. Elizabeth returns to Blair. But 
after futile efforts to win her love he finally agrees to free her and allows her to get 
a divorce and marry David. Helena, who has been ardently sought in marriage 
by Robert Ferguson, Elizabeth's uncle, at last gives in and acknowledges her love

up and down the land, to Padua, Ferrara, Genoa, Pompeii, Naples, Rome, and many 
other towns of picturesque buildings and melodious names, from Capri to Trieste. 
Mr. Howells knows his Italy so well that though he writes as a foreigner he is in perfect 
sympathy with his subject. He knows the innkeepers, guides, and railway men to be 
dead to truth and honesty, but he likes them; and he knows that Tasso's prison 
never held Tasso, and that the history of most of the historic places is purely legendary, 
but he delights to believe in them all. He sees in the broken columns and fragmentary 
walls of Pompeii all the splendor of the first century, that time of gorgeous wealth; 
and in an old house of Arqua, he has a vision of Petrarch writing at his curious carved 
table. In crumbling Herculaneum his spirit is touched to wistful sympathy by a 
garden of wild flowers: "Here where so long ago the flowers had bloomed, and 
perished in the terrible blossoming of the mountain that sent up its awful fires in the 
awful similitude of Nature's harmless and lovely forms, and showered its dcstroyr 
petals all abroad was it not tragic to find again the soft tints, the graceful sh 
the sweet perfumes, of the earth's immortal life? Of them that planted and tended 
and plucked and bore in their bosoms and twined in their hair these fragile children 
of the summer, what witness in the world? Only the crouching skeletons under the
tables. Alas, and alas." His love of the beautiful is tempered by a keen sense ol 
humor; and the combination makes his volume a delightful record, with the sunshine 
of Italy shut between its covers.</summary>
  <summary author="Scott, Walter (1771-1832)" title="Ivanhoe: A Romance" print_title="Ivanhoe:\nA Romance">IVANHOE, one of Sir Walter Scott's most famous novels, was written and published 
in 1819, a year of great domestic sorrow to its author. The manuscript is now at 
Abbotsford; and, according to Lockhart, is a remarkable and characteristic specimen 
of his penmanship. Immediately after its appearance, 'Ivanhoe' became a favorite. 
and now ranks among the most brilliant and stirring of romantic tales. Sir Wilfred, 
Knight of Ivanhoe, a young Saxon knight, brave, loyal, and handsome, is disinherited 
by his father, Cedric of Rotherwood, on account of his love for Rowena, a Saxon 
heiress and ward of Cedric's. Ivanhoe is a favorite with Richard, Coeur-de-Lion, 
has won renown in Palestine, and now returns in the disguise of a palmer to see 
Rowena at Rotherwood. Under the name of Desdichado (The Disinherited) he 
enters the lists of the Ashby Tournament; and having won the victory, is crowned 
by the Lady Rowena. He is wounded, however , and returns to the care of his friends, 
Isaac of York, a wealthy Jew, and his daughter Rebecca, The latter tends him, and 
loses her heart to this chivalrous knight. On returning from the Tournament, Rowena 
is captured by the enamored De Bracy and confined in the Tower of Torquil. 
After her release she is united in marriage to Ivanhoe, through the effort of 
Richard. While the Lady Rowena is a model of beauty, dignity, and gentleness. 
She is somewhat overshadowed by Rebecca, who was Scott's favorite of all his 
She is as generous as her father is avaricious; and although loving Ivanhoe with intense devotion, realizes that her union with him is impossible. She nobly
offers to the Templar Bois-Guilbcrt any sum that he may demand for the release of 
the imprisoned Rowena. A strong scene occurs when she defies this infatuated Crusader, and threatens to throw herself from the turret into the court yard. Bois 
Guilbert carries her to the Preceptory of Templestowe, where she is convicted of 
sorcery on account of her religion, her skill in medicine, and her attractiveness, 
Condemned to the stake, she is permitted a trial by combat, and selects Ivanhoe for 
her champion. Rebecca is pronounced guiltless and free.

Another important character is Richard the Lion-Hearted, who returns to England 
from Palestine at the moment when his brother's conspiracy against him is most 
rank. Disguised as the Black Sluggard and the Knight of the Fetterlock, he performs feats of valor at the Ashby Tournament and as the Black Knight, wanden 
through Sherwood Forest and holds high revel with the Hermit of Copmanhurst, th 
jovial Friar Tuck. Through Robin Hood he escapes assassination, and conducts the 
successful siege against Torquilstone Castle. Maurice de Bracy, a conspirator 
against King Richard, is a suitor for the hand of Rowena; Front de Bceuf is a brutal 
baron in league with Prince John; Cedric the Saxon, Ivanhoe's father, support 
Athelstane's suit for Rowena, desiring to see the Saxons reinstated; and Isaac Oi 
York, the wealthy Jew, is a well-drawn character. Gurth, Cedric's swineherd, who 
is generally accompanied by his faithful dog Fangs, is a typical feudal retainer; 
Wamba, Cedric's jester, is another; and Ulrica, a vindictive old Saxon hag, who 
perishes in the flames of Torquilstone Castle to which she sets fire, is one of those 
strange, half prophetic, half weird women whom Scott loves to introduce into his 
stories. 

In the scenes in Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood's men perform feats of archery and 
deeds of valor, drawn from the Robin Hood ballads and legends. 

Retainers, lords and ladies, knights, Templars, monks, priests, prisoners, jailors, 
and men-at-arms are introduced; and the book is full of brilliantly colored 
pictures of the period which abounds in contrast between the Saxons and the 
Normans. </summary>

skillful treatment would have made so tragical a tale revolting. But Daudet does 
not content himself with cold psychological analysis or brilliant exposition of character. 
His dominant quality is a passionate sympathy, whu-h communicates itself to his 
readers, and forces them to share his pity or anger or admiration. Jack, introduced 
to us as a pretty boy, beautifully dressed, might have lived an adequate life but for 
his light and selfish mother. He is sacrificed to her moral weakness, and to the 
bitter selfishness of his stepfather D'Argenton. The latter, a noble idealist in theory, 
while petty and base in practice, is jealous of this inconvenient, superfluous Jack 
and thrusts him outside the home. Jack's life is a long martyrdom, from his home-sick days with the little black King of Dahomey, in a nondescript school somewhat 
like the Dotheboys Hall made famous by Dickens, until his final "release" from a 
bed in the charity hospital. He becomes dull, sickly, inert; but his finer qualities 
die hard, and are perhaps only latent even during his worst days of labor in an iron 
foundry, and of fevered exhaustion as stoker on an ocean steamer. But life never 
becomes quite hopeless; for love and sympathy reach even to Jack, and offer him a 
partial compensation. After the publication of ' Jack, ' Daudet wrote a sketch of the 
original of the hero; for in its main outline the story is a true one. Here, as usual, 
he took a framework of fact, upon which his poetic instinct and sympathetic imagination worked.</summary>

is an account of that country by one who had identified himself as closely as a
European possibly could with the life of Japan and who was moreover a master of 
English style. After a graceful introduction, emphasizing the unfamiliarity and 
charm of Japan for the foreigner, he proceeds to an exposition of the religion and the 
social institutions of the country, laying great importance on the former as the spring 
of all Japanese art, ethics, and government. In Shintoism, an indigenous type of 
ancestor-worship, modified by Chinese culture and by Buddhism, he finds the essence 
of the Japanese religion. The principle of loyalty, whether to the family dead, or to 
the great men of the nation as represented in the government, is the fundamental in 
all Japanese conduct. Its elaboration by Buddhism both popular and philosophic, 
its modification in feudal times, its return to an earlier simplicity in the present cult 
of the Emperor are all pointed out. The crushing of Roman Catholicism in the 
seventeenth century is described as a process regrettable for its cruelty but necessary 
to the happy and successful development of the nation. The writer also looks with 
disfavor on such modern missionary effort as shows no tolerance for the principle of 
ancestor- worship, which, he maintains, in an essential factor in the social continuity 
of Japan. There are some interesting speculations on the future development, 
political, social, and religious, of the nation which had just discomfited Russia and 
entered the ranks of the modern military powers and industrial states. In general 
Hearn believed that the way of safety for Japan lay in conservatism as to the relinquishing of her old beliefs and institutions.</summary>

him elsewhere to die; but the stranger regains consciousness, and finds himself surrounded by a motley society of Russians, Italians, Poles, Jews, Danes, and Tsigane

set on foot between Jacob Harmon, an educated Jew, and the exile Jean Huba, 
familiarly known as Ivas. Their conversation serves to put the reader in possession 
of many facts in Jewish history. Jacob undertakes to convert Ivas to Judaism; and 
argues well, using politics and philosophy as well as religion for illustrations. They
agree to return to Poland to improve the intellectual condition of the Jews, become 
involved in political intrigues there, and are forced to quit the country. One or 
two love affairs give a slight tinge of romance to the story. The book is powerful,

years, from that time he is dependent on his own resources. He willingly undertakes 
any kind of honest work, and for three years gains a livelihood by working for farmers, 
but at the end of that time is taken into the employ of a Mr. Fletcher, a wealthy 
tanner. This is the beginning of his better fortune; for Phineas Fletcher, his master's 
invalid son, takes a great fancy to him and aids him with his education. The heroine 
is Ursula March; and the simple domestic story includes few minor characters. The 
interest lies in the development of character; and the author's assertion is that true 
nobility is of the soul, and does not inhere in wealth, in learning, or in position; and 
that integrity and loftiness of purpose form the character of a true gentleman. The

so preaches them with force and conviction. While his congregation agrees with 
him, his wife, who is the niece of a liberal, easy-going Episcopal rector, entertains 
decidedly broad theological views in general. The couple love each other with that 
singleness of devction without which the course of the story would be manifestly 
improbable; for it depends upon the question whether love will be able to hold together 
what conscientious habits of thought and ethical convictions tend to drive apart. 
The comments of the congregation of course have their part in promoting the difficulties that follow. The story is well told, and extremely interesting, although it confesses itself a problem-novel on the very first page.</summary>

satirical portraiture, written by the author at the time of his retirement from playwriting, 1742, owing to the prohibition of his plays by the Lord Chamberlain because 
of satirical allusions to persons of quality. At this time the writer, who was of noble 
descent and had been raised in affluence, was reduced to the hardships of poverty 
and the persecutions of many literary and social enemies; to actual suffering was added 
that of the extreme illness of his wife. His resentment at the disordered social conditions of the time, when merit was allowed to suffer and be laughed at, while dullness 
and vulgarity were worshiped in the highest circles, found vent in the three volumes 
of 'Miscellanies' published in 1743, the last of which contained the 'History of 
Jonathan Wild the Great.' Thus the work has its place between 'Joseph Andrews,' 
published in 1742, and the group of 'Torn Jones' (1749), and 'Amelia' (1751). 

'Jonathan Wild' portrays the life of a dissolute rake, and of his low-lived companions, male and female, in unrestrained and often revolting frankness. The hero, 
the embodiment of the "greatness" that is measured by success in crime and wickedness, is of descent more ancient than the Conqueror, his ancestor having come in 
with Hengist himself. Brought to London a youth, he is thrown in with a French 
Count La Ruse, of whom he learns the gambler's art so skillfully that the count 
himself soon falls victim to it. Conspiring with Bagshot and a gang of scoundrels and 
villains, he persecutes the innocent Heartfree and his family even to having them 
committed to prison. During the imprisonment Mrs. Heartfree tells the long tale of 
her adventures at sea, whither she had been allured by Wild after having her husband 
lodged in prison. Wild is married to Letitia Snap, a match with himself in deceit and 
vileness. They all are brought up at last in prison, and most of the characters come 
to the gallows. The visit of the ordinary of the prison to Wild, and their interview 
on the night before Wilds execution, is a sharp satire on the "consolations of religion " as afforded in that day. Between the chapters there are discourses on "greatness" as exhibited in its successive stages in the progress of Wild's villainy.</summary>

Fifteen years before the opening of the play, the Countess Beata and Baron Richard

does not cease the liaison is broken off. Beata's influence inspires Richard's ambition, 
and as the play opens she has induced her husband, a man of mediocre intelligence, to 
resign his seat in the Reichstag in favor of the brilliant Count Richard. During the 
political campaign, Richard's opponent, a former secretary, brings to light the secret 
of their past. Duty to their party forbids the public scandal of the divorce court or 
the duel for the outraged husband; the men ask Richard's young son what should be 
done in such a case, and he, not knowing he is judging his father, replies that "a man 
of honor would be more eager to give his life than the husband could possibly be to 
take it." It is understood by the two men, and guessed by Beata, that Richard will 
commit suicide. The party leaders call on Richard to make a speech against divorce 
upon the sanctity of the marriage bond. Beata makes him promise to attend a 
political luncheon she and her husband give the day following the speech for the 
sake of appearances. At the luncheon Beata proposes a toast to the joy of living.

  <summary author="Hardy, Thomas (1840-1928)" title="Jude the Obscure" print_title="Jude the Obscure">JUDE THE OBSCURE, a novel by Thomas Hardy (1896). The bar sinister which 
crosses many of his books is most prominent in 'Jude.' 

It is the story of a young man of the people, ambitious to go to Oxford and to 
become a scholar. He is prevented from rising in the social scale by himself, by his 
environment, by a vulgar natural woman who loves him, and by a refined morbid 
woman whom he loves. Arabella first drags him in the mud; Sue then seeks to soar 
with him to the stars. Between Arabella's earthiness and Sue's heavenly code of 
love, poor Jude has not a shred of morals left. 

He is pushed farther and farther from Oxford as the story goes on. The novel becomes at last a hopeless jumble of illegitimate children, other men's wives, misery, more 
misery, revolt, and death. It is a remarkable work, but not a cheerful or pleasant one.</summary>
  <summary author="Parker, Gilbert (1862-1932)" title="The Judgment House" print_title="The Judgment House">JUDGMENT HOUSE, THE, by Gilbert Parker (1913). This is a powerful story 
dealing with social and political life in England. It opens at the opera in London, 
when Rudyard Byng, a young multi-millionaire, who has made his fortune in South 
Africa by his own efforts, meets for the first time Jasmine Grenfel. The latter, a 
beautiful but ambitious girl, is the same as engaged to Ian Stafford, a brilliant young 
diplomat, who has been devoted to her for some time and who is responsible for the 
introduction of Byng. At the close of the opera the clothing of the Prima Donna, 
who is named Almah, accidently catches fire, but the prompt action of Byng, who 
rushes to her rescue prevents a catastrophe. Jasmine, who is impressed by Byng's 
strong character, as well as by his great wealth, throws over Stafford and accepts 
Byng's offer of marriage, though she is not really in love with him. Three years 
elapse and Stafford, who has spent the time in foreign service, returns to England, 
where he and Jasmine meet again. Stafford treats Jasmine with indifference and in 
pique she makes up her mind to win him back to her. She succeeds in doing this and 
by political intriguing gets him an appointment for which he is working. At the 
same time she finds herself deeply in love with him and realizes that she has always 
cared for him. Jasmine has other admirers, one of whom is Adrian Fellowes who 
has had a long standing affair with Almah. A love-letter, written by Fellowes to 
Jasmine, falls into her husband's hands and he is horrified at the knowledge of her 
disloyalty. He denounces Fellowes and orders him to leave the country but before 
his departure Fellowes is mysteriously murdered. No clue is found to the murderer, 
and Stafford suspects Jasmine, and Jasmine and her husband suspect each other. 
The Boer War is declared and Byng and Stafford join the army, while Jasmine, who 
has separated from her husband, gives most of her money for a hospital ship and goes 
with it to South Africa, as a nurse. Almah also is there in the same capacity and 
confesses to the murder of Fellowes who had deceived her. Stafford is finally killed 
in battle, and Rudyard and Jasmine are again united, the latter realizing at last that 
she is deeply in love with her husband.</summary>
  <summary author="Sinclair, Upton (1878-1968)" title="The Jungle" print_title="The Jungle">JUNGLE, THE, by Upton Sinclair (1906). In this book the author has vividly 
portrayed life in the Chicago stockyards and his revelations are so shocking and 
revolting that one cannot read them without being rilled with horror. In fact after
the book's publication the indignation of the general public was aroused and an 
investigation into the prevailing conditions of the stockyards was instituted by the 
United States government. The central figure in the story is Jurgis Rudkus, a poor 
Slav immigrant, who comes to the new world to make his fortune. He is accompanied on his venture by his father, Ona Lukoszaite the girl to whom he is engaged, 
and her family consisting of a stepmother and half a dozen brothers and sisters. 
Their experiences are harrowing in the extreme; they are cheated, abused, and 
oppressed on every hand, suffer privations of every kind and find death a blessed 
release when it finally ends their sufferings. In the beginning of the story Jurgis is 
young and strong, and fortified by undaunted courage and hope, but after struggling 
against the terrible conditions which surround him without avail, he becomes 
wrecked physically and morally. The first year of existence in the new country is 
hard for the newcomers, but they manage to get work in the yards and keep their 
heads above water, and Jurgis and Ona are married. Soon after, however, their 
troubles begin to increase and misfortunes of every kind overtake them. Ill treatment 
from those who employ them, unhealthy conditions where they are forced to work, 
and other evils, undermine their health and happiness. One by one the members of 
this unfortunate household sicken and die, working to the last in order to do their 
part in the great struggle. The death of Ona is particularly tragic as she dies in 
giving birth to her second child surrounded by the most frightful conditions of 
poverty and want that can be imagined. Jurgis takes to drink and finding it impossible to gain a living in an honest way gives way to the temptations that surround 
him and becomes utterly debased. In conclusion Jurgis becomes a socialist hoping 
thereby to improve his condition. Throughout the story the dominating influence 
of the trades' unions is strikingly illustrated and the futility of a workingman's 
struggle against them.</summary>
  <summary author="Kipling, Rudyard (1865-1936)" title="The Jungle Book" print_title="The Jungle Book">JUNGLE BOOKS, THE, by Rudyard Kipling. The central figure in these books is 
the boy Mowgli, who, straying from his village home when an infant, had been lost 
in the forest, and there sheltered and nursed with her own cubs by a mother-wolf, 
and the hairy Orson. Joined to this element of human interest, and with the coloring 
of high romance, these stories picture the personal characteristics and social and 
political life of the gaunt wolf family in their cave and the free republic of wolves, 
assembled in the Pack; the snarling Bengal tiger, Shere Khan, who, though fearful, 
like the other beasts, of man's superior wit, roams boastfully for prey, attended by his 
obsequious but mischief making jackal servant, Tabaqui, the Dish-Licker; they tell 
about Baloo, "the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf-cubs the Law of the Jungle, 
which is the reproof of human codes in its comprehensive justice"; the black panther, 
Bagheera; Kaa, the big rock python; and many others, including the monkey people, 
filthy chatterers despised by all the rest. They describe also how Mowgli's coming 
disturbed these forest creatures; how his human will proved more powerful than 
Shere Khan's jaws and claws; and how the brown bear and other friends rescued him 
with some trouble when he had been carried off through the tree-tops by the monkey 
people; and how he finally went back to live among men, but with a better knowledge 
of beasts. Unlike the talking beasts in JLsop's fables, those of the 'Jungle Books' 
are not men in hides and on all fours discussing human problems. Kipling's genius 
represents them thinking and behaving, each according to his own peculiar beastly 
habit and experience, with such dramatic skill that one is almost forced to believe 
that he has intimately dwelt among them as Mowgli did. The stories were published 
in St. Nicholas, and collected into two volumes in 1894 and 1895.</summary>

musical genius and who by his loving and unworldly nature wins the hearts of all 
about him. The death of David's father, a once celebrated musician, who has 
brought the motherless boy up in a lonely cabin on a mountain-top, teaching him to 
love nature and his music, leaves the orphan of ten years, a wanderer with only his 
violin for company. The boy is taken into the household of a farmer, named Holley, 
who with his wife, takes pity upon the waif. At first David finds his new home 
almost unbearable as Mr. and Mrs. Holley are plain, hard-working people with little 
sympathy for the artistic and spiritual side of life to which the boy has been accustomed in his intercourse with his father. David's past is a mystery, as a letter left 
by his father, which contains certain suggestions for his future, has a signature which 
none of the village-folk can decipher. David makes many friends among both rich 
and poor; he brightens the life of a blind boy, Joe Glaspell, to whom he lends his 
father's violin, and becomes devotedly attached to a rich and beautiful young woman 
named Barbara Holbrook, whom he calls his "Lady of Roses." He acquires a warm 
friend in Jack Guernsey, a young man who is in love with Barbara Holbrook, but 
who does not approach her on account of her great wealth and his own poverty. 
Guernsey's little sister Jill becomes David's playmate and they spend happy hours 
together. When at last David becomes dangerously ill his many friends realize his 
worth in the community and lavish attentions upon him. By his bedside Jack 
Guernsey and Barbara Holbrook meet and are reunited through the boy's efforts. 
Mr. and Mrs. Holley, who are softened by the boy's influence, become reconciled to 
their son John, from whom they have been estranged for years. John returns and 
discovers that David's father was a world-famous musician and that wealthy relatives are awaiting the coming of the gifted child, who is from this time to have the 
long-dreamed-of opportunity to develop his art.</summary>

  <summary author="Scott, Walter (1771-1832)" title="Kenilworth" print_title="Kenilworth">KENILWORTH, by Sir Walter Scott, appeared in 1819, when its author was fifty 
and had long been distinguished both as poet and novelist. 'Kenilworth' was the 
second of his great romances drawn from English history. The central figure is 
that of Elizabeth, the haughty queen. She is surrounded by the brilliant and famous 
characters of the period Burleigh, Edmund Spenser, Sir Walter Raleigh; and also 
by a host of petty sycophants. The Earl of Surrey and the Earl of Leicester are 
rivals, each high in her favor, each thought to be cherishing a hope of winning her 
hand. But beguiled by the charms of Amy Robsart, the daughter of a country 
gentleman, Leicester has secretly married her, and established her at Cumnor Place, 
a lonely manor-house where she lives with surly Tony Foster as guardian, and his 
honest young daughter, Janet, as attendant. Amy had formerly been engaged to 
Tressilian, a worthy protege of her father. Tressilian discovers her hiding-place; and 
not believing her married, vainly tries to induce her to return home. He then appeals 
to the queen before the whole court. A disclosure of the truth means Leicester's 
ruin, but seems inevitable, when his confidential follower, the unscrupulous Richard 
Varney, saves the situation. He affirms Amy to be his own wife, and is ordered to 
appear with her at the approaching revels at Kenilworth, Leicester's castle, which 
the queen is to visit. Amy scornfully refuses to appear as Varney's wife, and Varney 
attempts to drug her. In fear of her life, she escapes and makes her way to Kenilworth. The magnificent pageant prepared there for Elizabeth, and the motley crowds 
flocking to witness it, are brilliantly described. Amy cannot gain access to her 
husband, but is discovered and misjudged by Tressilian. The Queen finds her half-fainting in a grotto, and again Varney keeps her from learning the truth. He persuades Elizabeth that Amy is mad. He persuades Leicester that she is false and loves 
Tressilian, and obtains the earl's signet ring and authority to act for him. Amy is 
hurried back to Cumnor Place. There, decoyed from her room by her husband's 
signal, she steps on a trap-door prepared by Varney and Foster, and is plunged to 
death, just before Tressilian and Sir Walter Raleigh arrive to take her back to Kenilworth. They have been sent by Elizabeth to whom Leicester, discovering the injustice of his suspicions, has confessed all. He falls into the deepest disgrace; and 
Elizabeth, feeling herself insulted both as queen and as woman, treats him with scorn 
and contempt. 'Kenilworth' is regarded as one of the most delightful of English 
historical romances.</summary>
  <summary author="Smith, Francis Hopkinson (1838-1915)" title="Kennedy Square" print_title="Kennedy Square">KENNEDY SQUARE, by F. Hopkinson Smith (1911). This is a story of life in the 
South in the Ante-Bellum days. Kennedy Square is an aristocratic spot in one of 
Maryland's principal cities, and here abides St. George Temple, in the ancestral 
mansion which his family has occupied for generations. He is a genial bachelor of 
middle age, who dispenses hospitality in a generous and courtly fashion, and is 
beloved by all, especially by the young people to whom he is "Uncle George." His 
particular favorites in this circle are Harry Rutter and Kate Seymour, both endowed 
with wealth, social position and personal charm, and who are in love with each other. 
Their engagement is to be announced at a large ball given by Harry's parents, but 
while it is in progress, and before the good news has been made public, Langdon 
Willetts, one of Harry's rivals, being excited by liquor, insults Kate. Harry's hot 
blood is aroused and he challenges Willetts to a duel, which takes place immediately, 
and Willetts is seriously wounded. This unhappy occurrence causes Harry's proud 
and autocratic father to disown him on the spot, as he considers his son has disgraced 
his blood by shooting a guest under his own roof. Kate also heart-broken over the 
affair, tells Harry all is over between them. St. George then slips into the breach and 
exonerating Harry from blame says he shall henceforth be as his own son. Harry 
stays with St. George until business reverses come to him and then rather than be a 
burden on his kind friend he books as a common, seaman on a ship sailing for South 
America and is gone for three years. On his return he finds his kind Uncle George in 
poor health, reduced to absolute poverty, and living in the wretched home of one of 
his faithful negro servants. Harry makes immediate plans to restore to his old 
friend his home and his beloved possessions and is successful in his efforts. He and 
his father become reconciled and he is re-united to Kate who has never ceased to love 
him. The story closes with the return of St. George to his ancestral home, which 
Harry and Elate have restored and put in perfect order for his coming.</summary>
  <summary author="Stevenson, Robert Louis (1850-1894)" title="Kidnapped" print_title="Kidnapped">KIDNAPPED, by Robert Louis Stevenson, was published in 1886, when the author 
was thirty-six, and was his seventh work of fiction. In his own opinion, it was his 
best novel; and it is generally regarded as one of his finest performances in romantic 
story-telling. The full title reads: 'Kidnapped: Being Memoirs of the Adventures 
of David Balfour in the Year 1751'; and the contents of the tale are further indicated 
on the title-page, thus: "How he was Kidnapped and Cast away; his Sufferings in a 
Desert Isle; his Journey in the Wild Highlands; his Acquaintance with Alan Breck 
Stewart and other notorious Highland Jacobites; with all that he Suffered at the 
hands of his Uncle, Ebenezer Balfour of Shaws, falsely so called." David, on his 
father's death, visits his uncle near Edinburgh, and finds him a miser and villain, who, 
to get rid of his nephew, packs him off on the brig Covenant, intending to have him 
sold in America. On shipboard he falls in with Alan, the dare-devil Jacobite, one of 
the most spirited and vivid characterizations of Stevenson. David espouses the 
Stuart cause, and in company with Alan has a series of lively experiences narrated 
with great swing and color. The fight in the roundhouse of the brig, the flight in the 
heather from the red-coats of King George, and other scenes, are conceived and 
carried out in the finest vein of romance. After these wanderings, David, circumventing his rascally uncle, comes into his own.</summary>
  <summary author="Kipling, Rudyard (1865-1936)" title="Kim" print_title="Kim">KIM, by Rudyard Kipling (1901). In this brilliant piece of work the author offers 
a new example of his remarkable versatility. It exhibits his extraordinary power 
of characterization as well as his probably unsurpassed knowledge of Indian 
modes and customs. Kimball O'Hara, known as Kim, is a little vagabond of Irish 
parentage, orphaned when a baby, and left to shift for himself in the depths of the 
native quarter of Lahore. He meets an aged lama from Thibet, who is seeking 
the all-healing River of the Arrows, or stream of Immortality, and roams through 
India in his company. The two are lodged and fed by the pious people of the country and as they tramp abotit undergoing manifold experiences, a deep affection 
springs up between them. Kim is presently recognized, reclaimed and adopted by 
the Irish regiment, to which his father belonged, and is given an education in a 
Catholic college. He endures the thraldom of St. Xavier's in Lucknow, only upon the
condition of being allowed to tramp the continent in the long vacation with his 
beloved Buddhist priest. Col. Creighton discovers Kim's remarkable fitness for 
employment in the Secret Service of the English government and he receives tuition 
from proficient natives. The result is that he distinguishes himself while yet a 
stripling by capturing in the high Himalayas, the credentials and dispatches of a 
formidable Russian spy. The author takes leave of Kim in the flush of his first 
victory. The book contains a marvelous picture of India with its wealth and poverty, 
and its crowded cities teeming with human life, where, with Earn, one may enter the 
bazaars of the natives and become intimately acquainted with the "brown" men and 
women who live and move in an atmosphere of their own. One may view the forgotten temples and holy rivers and terrible stretches of burning plain, and learn to 
appreciate the grandeur of the magnificent mountain barrier of the North. In ' Kim,' 
Kipling seems to have embodied not only the wonderful material and physical aspect, 
but the human soul of the Orient.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="King John" print_title="King John">KING JOHN, a drama by Shakespeare, the source of which is an older play published 
in 1591. The date of the action is 1200 A. D. John is on the throne of England, 
but without right; his brother, Richard the Lion-Hearted, had made his nephew 
Arthur of Bretagne his heir. Arthur is a pure and amiable lad of fourteen, the pride 
and hope of his mother Constance. The maternal affection and the sorrows of this 
lady form a central feature of the drama. Arthur's father Geoffrey has long been 
dead, but his mother has enlisted in his behalf the kings of Austria and of France. 
Their forces engage King John's army under the walls of Angiers. While the day is 
still undecided, peace is made, and a match formed between Lewis, dauphin of France, 
and John's niece Blanche. The young couple are scarcely married when the pope's 
legate causes the league to be broken. The armies again clash in arms, and John is 
victorious, and carries off Prince Arthur to England, where he is confined in a castle 
and confided to one Hubert. John secretly gives a written warrant to Hubert to put 
him to death. The scene in which the executioners appear with red-hot irons to put 
out the boy's eyes, and his innocent and affectionate prattle with Hubert, reminding 
him how he had watched by him when ill, is one of the most famous and pathetic in 
all the Shakespearian historical dramas. Hubert relents; but the frightened boy 
disguises himself as a sailor lad, and leaping down from the walls of the castle, is 
killed. Many of the powerful lords of England are so infuriated by this pitiful event 
(virtually a murder, and really thought to be such by them), that they join the 
Dauphin, who has landed to claim England's crown in the name of his wife. 
King John meets him on the battle-field, but is taken ill, and forced to retire to 
Swinstcad Abbey. He has been poisoned by a monk, and dies in the orchard 
of the abbey in great agony. His right-hand man in his wars and in counsel has 
been a bastard son of Richard I., by Lady Faulconbridge. The bastard figures 
conspicuously in the play as braggart and ranter; yet he is withal brave and 
patriotic to the last. Lewis, the dauphin, it should be said, makes peace and retires 
to France.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="King Lear" print_title="King Lear">KING LEAR. Shakespeare's great drama, 'King Lear,' was written between 1603 
and 1606. The bare historical outline of the story of the King he got probably from 
Holinshed or from an old play, the 'Chronicle History of Leir'; the sad story of 
Gloster was found in Sir Philip Sidney's 'Arcadia.' The motifs of the drama are 
the wronging of children by parents and of parents by children. With the fortunes of the King are interwoven those of Cluster, Lear has she-devils for daughters
(Goneril and Regan), and one ministering angel, Cordelia; Gloster has a he-devil fot 
son (Edmund), and one faithful son, Edgar. The lustre of goodness in Cordelia, 
Edgar, Albany, loyal Kent, and the faithful Fool, redeems human nature, redresses 
the balance. At the time the play opens, Lear is magnanimously dividing his kingdom between his sons-in-law Cornwall and Albany. But he has already a predisposition to madness, shown by his furious wrath over trifles, his childish bids for 
affection, and his dowering of his favorite daughter Cordelia with poverty and a 
perpetual curse, simply for a little willful reserve in expressing her really profound 
love for him. Blind impulse alone sways him; his passions are like inflammable gas; 
for a mere whim he banishes his best friend, Kent. Coming into the palace of Goneril, 
after a day's hunt with his retinue of a hundred knights, his daughter (a fortnight 
after her father's abdication) calls his men riotous and asks him to dismiss half of 
them.- Exasperated to the point of fury, he rushes out tired and supperless into a 
wild night storm; he is cut to the heart by her ingratitude. And there before the 
hovel, in the presence of Kent, the disguised Edgar, and the Fool, insanity sets in 
and never leaves him until he dies at Dover by the dead body of Cordelia. In a 
hurricane of fearful events the action now rushes on: Gloster's eyes are plucked out, 
and he wanders away to Dover, where Cordelia, now Queen of France, has landed 
with an army to restore her father to his rights. Thither, too, the stricken Lear is 
borne at night. The joint queens, most delicate friends, lust after Edmund. Regan, 
made a widow by the death of Cornwall, is poisoned by Goneril. Cordelia and Lear 
are taken prisoner, and Cordelia is hanged by Edmund's order. Edmund is slain in 
the trial by combat. Lear dies; Gloster and Kent are brokenhearted and dying; 
Regan has stabbed herself; Edgar and Albany alone survive. The Fool in 'Lear' is a 
man of tender feeling, and clings to his old comrade, the King, as to a brother. His 
jests are like smiles seen through tears; they relieve the terrible strain on our feelings. 
Edmund is a shade better than lago; his bastardy, with its rankling humiliations, is 
an assignable cause, though hardly a palliation of his guilt.</summary>

first published in 1809, Washington Irving says: "Nothing more was contemplated
than a jeu esprit, written in a serio-comic vein, and treating local errors, follies, 
and abuses with good-humored satire." Diedrich Knickerbocker is the imaginary 
historian who records the traditions of New Amsterdam. The book begins with the 
creation of the world, the discovery of America by the Dutch, and the settlement of 
the New Netherlands. Hendrick Hudson appears, with other navigators; there are 
descriptions of the "Bouwerie," Bowling Green, the Battery, and Fort Amsterdam, 
with the quaint Dutch houses, tiled roofs, and weathercocks, all complete. Dutchmen 
in wide trousers, big hats, feathers, and large boots, continually puffing long pipes, 
are seen with their wives and daughters in voluminous petticoats, shoes with silver 
buckles, girdles, and neat head-dresses. Along the Hudson sail high-pooped Dutch 
ships. Legends of the island of Manhattan and its surrounding shores are interwoven 
with the humorous chronicle. The history treats of Oloffe Van Kortlandt, the valiant 
"Kip, the Ten Broecks, Hans Reiner Oothout, the renowned Wouter Van Twiller, 
descendant of a long line of burgomasters, the patroon Killian Van Rensselaer, Stoffel 
Brinkerhoff, William Kieft called "William the Testy," Antony Van Corlear the 
trumpeter, Peter Stuyvesant with his silver leg, and a complement of Indians, Dutch, 
and Yankee settlers. " Before the appearance of my work, " says Irving, "the popular traditions of our city were unrecorded; the peculiar and racy customs and usages 
derived from our Dutch progenitors were unnoticed or regarded with indifference, or 
adverted to with a sneer." </summary>

visited by a young man from the North who makes quite a sojourn within its sacred 
limits, and has brought letters which admit him to the inner circles of society. The 
title of the story is derived from a certain kind of cake which is described as being 
most delectable and goes by the name of " Lady Baltimore." The visitor has his first 
introduction to it when he is taking luncheon at the Woman's Exchange, which is 
presided over by a very charming young woman whom he afterwards learns is Miss 
Eliza La Heu, a member of one of the oldest families but who is financially reduced. 
On this occasion, the visitor becomes interested in a young man who comes to the 
Exchange to order a Lady Baltimore cake for his wedding the following week. The 
visitor's curiosity being aroused he makes inquiries and finds that the young man is 
named John Mayrant and that he is also a member of an aristocratic family and is 
making a match which is highly disapproved of by his relations. The young lady 
in question who possesses beauty and much worldly wisdom is Hortense Rieppe, 
the daughter of an indigent General. She arrives upon the scene with a party of 
fashionable friends in the automobile of a rich admirer known to the reader as 
"Charley," and the visitor is puzzled to find out how John Mayrant fits into her 
scheme of life. He surmises that John has changed in his feelings towards Hortense but is too honorable to withdraw. The denouement comes when Hortense 
jumps overboard from Charley's steam yacht to try her lovers and on being rescued 
by John, the latter feels that he can honorably release himself from his engagement 
and does so on the spot. John then marries Eliza who was to have made the wedding 
cake for Hortense and makes it instead for her own wedding, and Hortense marries 
Charley who will be able to supply her with all the worldly goods she requires.</summary>

del Castiglione, a penniless young officer. After the marriage, a flirtation which at 
first seems harmless, is indulged in by the young wife and her old lover but before 
they realize their danger their passion has carried them beyond the limits of virtue. 
In course of time Maria's husband discovers the truth and being an honorable and 
generous man, avoids a public scandal and leaving his wife quietly goes to live with 
his mother in Spain. Maria continues to live in Rome with unsullied reputation 
and devotes herself to her son Leone, whose unlikeness to the Count cannot fail to 
be noticed. After seven years of absence Castiglione returns to Rome and Maria
realizes that she still adores the man she has tried so hard to despise. Castiglione, 
who has bitterly repented of his sin and has since led a blameless life, sues for Maria's 
forgiveness and they agree to a platonic friendship. Soon after this the Count's 
mother dies and he writes to Maria begging for a reconciliation, as he still loves her 
passionately and she acquiesces to his proposal though she has no affection for him 
and is actually repelled by his presence. The Count returns and he and Maria take 
up life again, she promising to put Castiglione from her forever. This is a difficult 
proceeding and she goes frequently to the confessional for help. Finally some old 
love-letters of Castiglione's are stolen from her desk and are used for the purpose 
of blackmail. The matter is straightened out by Castiglione through the intervention of Maria's confessor, but her husband convinced that Maria has deceived him 
again becomes violently angry. He appreciates his mistake and is filled with remorse 
but is stricken with apoplexy and dies, leaving a letter telling Maria to marry Castiglione, which it is assumed she will do, after a proper period has elapsed.</summary>
  <summary author="Howells, William Dean (1837-1920)" title="The Lady of the Aroostook" print_title="The Lady\nof\nthe Aroostook">LADY OF THE AROOSTOOK, THE, a novel of the present day, by W. D. Howells, 
was published in 1879. In its heroine, Lydia Blood, is drawn the portrait of a lady 
of nature's own making. She is a New England school-teacher, young, beautiful, 
and fragile. For the benefit of the sea voyage she leaves her grandparents on a remote 
New England farm, to visit an aunt and an uncle in Venice. Two of her fellow passengers on the Aroostook are a Mr. Dunham and a Mr. Stamford, young gentlemen not at first attracted by a girl who says "I want to know." Before the voyage is 
over, however, Mr. Stamford falls in love with Lydia, whose high-bred nature cannot be concealed by her village rusticity. In Venice, among fashionable sophisticated people, she shows in little nameless ways that she is a lady in the true sense. 
The book closes with her marriage to Staniford. 

'The Lady of the Aroostook' is in Howells's earlier manner, its genial realism 
imparting to it an atmosphere of delicate comedy. </summary>
  <summary author="Stockton, Frank Richard (1834-1902)" title="The Lady, or the Tiger?" print_title="The Lady,\nor the Tiger?">LADY OR THE TIGER, THE, the first of a brief collection of short stories published 
under this title in 1884. A semi-barbaric king of olden times had decreed that every 
person accused of crime should be placed in a vast amphitheatre, where, in the 
presence of the king, the court, and the assembled multitude he was compelled to 
open one of two doors which were exactly alike and side by side. He might open 
which ever door he pleased, but had absolutely no guidance or suggestion to direct 
"Him. Behind one door was a hungry, man-eating tiger and behind the other a 
beautiful lady, dressed as a bride. If he opened the door which concealed the tiger 
he was at once devoured, and the operation of chance was judged to have proved 
him guilty; if he opened the door which concealed the lady, he was held to be proved 
innocent and was immediately married to her with great rejoicings. No previous 
ties were allowed to put a stop to this marriage. The disposition of the lady and of 
the tiger behind the two doors was subject to change on every occasion and was, of 
course r a profound secret. Now it happened that a young courtier of humble rank 
won the love of the king's daughter; and being detected by the king was imprisoned 
and brought to trial in the arena. The princess by means of gold and a woman's 
determination discovered behind which doors the lady and the tiger were -to be placed. 
She went through a long and agonized conflict between horror at the thought of her 
lover's destruction by a ferocious tiger and jealousy at the idea of his possession by 
another, the fairest maid of honor of the court. At length her mind was made up. 
On the day of the trial she unobtrusively signalled to her lover, to open the right-hand door. This he immediately did. The author does not undertake to say what 
followed, but leaves the question to his readers: "Which came out of the opened 
door, the lady, or the tiger?" The force and succinctness of this story, the surprise 
of the conclusion, and the piquancy of the concluding question (which has a parallel 
in the questions d'amour of the mediaeval courts of love) have made this tale justly 
famous.</summary>

and Bridget his wife, Shawn, their son and his "newly-married bride, Maire," and the 
village priest, Father Hart, are sitting in the kitchen in the twilight. Old Bridget 
has been scolding her son's wife for reading a book about the fairies, instead of helping

characters and scenes of this story are in a great measure suggested by the peculiarities 
of the buildings which are still to be seen at Pompeii. The tale begins a few days 
before the destruction of Pompeii, and ends with that event. The simple story relates principally to two young people of Grecian origin, Glaucus and lone, who 
are deeply attached to each other. The former is a handsome young Athenian, 
impetuous, high-minded, and brilliant, while lone is a pure and lofty-minded woman. 
Arbaces, her guardian, the villain of the story, under a cloak of sanctity and religion, 
indulges in low and criminal designs. His character is strongly drawn; and his 
passion for lone, and the struggle between him and Glaucus, form the chief part of 
the plot. Nydia, the blind girl, who pines in unrequited affection for Glaucus, and 
who saves the lives of the lovers at the time of the destruction of the city, by conducting them in safety to the s^a, is a touching and beautiful conception. The book, full 
of learning and spirit, is not only a charming novel, but contains many minute and 
interesting descriptions of ancient customs; among which, those relating to the 
gladiatorial combat, the banquet, the bath, are most noteworthy.</summary>

  <summary author="Huxley, Thomas Henry (1825-1895)" title="Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews" print_title="Lay Sermons,\nAddresses\nand\nReviews">LAY SERMONS, ADDRESSES, AND REVIEWS, by Thomas Henry Huxley, a 
series of fifteen lectures and essays, written at various times between 1854 and 1870 
and collected in the latter year. Six of the individual essays or addresses are educational, pleading for the recognition of natural science as not only a utilitarian but 
also a liberal study. Huxley had deep convictions on this subject, and strong opposition to overcome. He writes, therefore, with great vigor and effectiveness, as also 
in the two articles defending Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' Two of the lectures were 
delivered with the aim of popularizing scientific knowledge. The address 'On the 
Physical Basis of Life' shows that every living creature is formed by different dispositions of one substance protoplasm, and argues that this material substance is 
the source of all life; at the same time Huxley repudiates the charge of materialism 
on the ground that he makes no inquiry into the essential nature of protoplasm,
since that question is unanswerable. 'On a Piece of Chalk/' a lecture delivered to 
workingmen in Norwich, makes the chalk a text for a discourse on geology and the 
origin of species. The chalk, being composed of the shells of aquatic animals, 
naturally leads to these topics. An address on Descartes traces the influence of his 
philosophy through the two developments of idealism and scepticism, and a review 
of one of Huxley's hostile critics emphasizes the distinction between agnosticism 
and positivism. Finally, there are three presidential addresses, delivered before 
scientific societies, on evolution as applied to geology and to botany, and on spontaneous generation. The value and charm of these essays lie in their honesty, directness, 
simplicity, clearness, and incisive reasoning power.</summary>

founded upon the legend that at the time of the French Revolution, the Dauphin 
was spirited away to America by the court painter Bellenger. In the story the 
young Prince grows up among the Indians of the Northwest under the name of 
Eleazer Williams softened by them to Lazarre. Having been reduced almost to 
imbecility by previous harsh treatment, the child at first believes himself to be the 
son of the Indian chief in whose care he has been placed. Under the healthful 
influence of the climate, he regains both mental and physical strength and, attracting 
the notice of the settlers, gains an education. While studying at the manor house, 
he falls in love with Eagle, Madame De Ferrier, who recognizes him as the Dauphin, 
seen by her years before in St. Bat's Church, London. When news is received from 
France of the death of Eagle's husband, Lazarre confesses his love and asks her hand 
in marriage. Though deeply attached to him, she tells him she cannot marry a 
King, and starts for France to reclaim her estates. He follows her to France and 
mingles in the brilliant court of Napoleon, making an unsuccessful plea for recognition to Louis XVIII. After various thrilling adventures he returns to his beloved 
wilderness in America, where, after years of waiting and searching, he finds Eagle 
for whom he renounces the crown, which is offered him by an envoy of the Bourbons, who turn to him as a last resource. The story is one of sustained interest and 
displays the author's knowledge of the wild country in the old time, as well as her 
fertile imagination. The character of the Prince is an interesting study and that of 
Eagle is drawn with remarkable charm and skill.</summary>
  <summary author="Whitman, Walt (1819-1892)" title="Leaves of Grass" print_title="Leaves of Grass">LEAVES OF GRASS, a collection of poems in free rhythms by Walt Whitman, first 
published in 1855, and re-issued with additional poems in 1856, in 1860, in 1866, in 
1871, and in 1 8 76. Whitman said that the purpose of the book was "to articulate and 
faithfully express in literary or poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, 
emotional, moral, intellectual, and assthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying, 
the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current America 
and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date, in a far more candid 
and comprehensive sense than in any hitherto poem or book." 'Leaves of Grass' is 
accordingly the frankest self-revelation, the fullest embodiment of American life, 
and the most original stylistic and metrical experiment of any poetical work ever 
published. Whitman portrays himself as a lover of life in all its forms, particularly 
of men and women, a wanderer of city streets, country roads, battlefields, and hospitals, 
eager to fraternize with people of every rank, and especially with the rough and poor. 
He is keenly sensitive to all the delights of life, physical, mental, and spiritual, and 
it is his cardinal doctrine that matter, mind, and spirit are equally noble; hence the 
extreme sensuousness of some of his poems never becomes sensuality but is a part of 
his faith in the goodness of life as a whole. But above all the joys of physical satisfaction, beautiful landscape, human comradeship, and spiritual contemplation, is the 
joy of self-consciousness, the feeling of his individual being. It is not conceit or exaggerated egotism but a delight in being alive, which turns impatiently from doctrines 
of asceticism and original sin to happy contemplation of self and the world. One of the 
longest poems of the collection is entitled ' Song of Myself,' and this title might have 
been given to the whole book. Again, Whitman is an American through and through, 
and his poems depict almost every conceivable type of American landscape, American 
social life, and American manhood and womanhood, as observed by a man who had 
mingled with it all in a human, democratic way. On the sea-beaches of Long Island, 
the crowded ferries and pavements of Manhattan, the farms and lumber-camps of the 
Alleghanies, the tents and battlefields of the Civil War, the plantations of the South, 
the prairies, the Rockies, the Pacific Coast, and hundreds of other typical American 
backgrounds he constantly portrays that sense of equality, comradeship, and confident 
hopefulness in pioneer enterprise which is the distinctive American characteristic. 
Most striking of all Whitman's peculiarities, however, is the freedom of his style and 
metre. Discarding all literary references and borrowings, all conventional and ornamental poetic diction, and all regular measures, he wrote in a style which, though 
fluent and exuberant in imagery, was clear and direct. His typical poetic form is a 
long rhapsody in lines of a length and metre varying with the emotional mood and 
of a rhythm exquisitely corresponding to it. The predominating line is very long, 
of six, seven, or eight stresses, and an undetermined number of unstressed syllables; 
such long lines are occasionally varied by the insertion of very short lines. Whitman's work is by no means to be called "prose poetry" for it has a very marked 
poetic though unstandardized rhythm; and, although the logical connection of 
his thought is not always fully expressed, each poem, and indeed the whole 
work, has an organic unity of idea and sentiment. Although the frankness 
of some of Whitman's verse injured his reputation among the more Puritanic 
of his fellow-countrymen, his powers were early recognized by men of letters, 
including Emerson. They were eagerly read in English and French intellectual 
circles and have been highly influential in the development of twentieth-century 
verse, English and American.</summary>

criticism, addressed in a spirit of gentle humor to the "dear, dead women" and men 
of whom they treat. The ninth, to Master Isaak Walton, begins: "Father Isaak 
When I would be quiet and go angling, it is my custom to carry in my wallet thy 
pretty book, 'The Compleat Angler.' Here, methinks, if I find not trout I shall find 
content." The letter to Theocritus is heavy with the scent of roses and dew-drenched violets. The author's pagan sympathies lead him to inquire "In the 
House of Hades, Theocritus, doth there dwell aught that is fair? and can the low 
light on the fields of Asphodel make thee forget thy Sicily? Does the poet remember 
Nycheia with her April eyes?" To Thackeray he says: "And whenever you speak 
in earnest, how magical, how rare, how lonely in our literature is the beauty of your 
sentences!" And to Dumas: "Than yours there has been no greater nor more kindly 
and beneficent force in modern letters." Each letter gives the serene compliments of 
the author to the author on what was really best in his work. Each letter is gay and 
unassuming, but under the nonchalance is the fine essence of criticism. An odor as of 
delicate wine pervades the volume, the fragrance of an oblation to the great Dead, 
by a lover of their work.</summary>
  <summary author="Hobbes, Thomas (1588-1679)" title="Leviathan" print_title="Leviathan">LEVIATHAN, or 'The Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical 
and Civil,' a political and sociological treatise by Thomas Hobbes, published in 1651. 
The book was written in defence of monarchy but its arguments were based not on 
divine right but on natural law. After a psychological analysis of man as an individual, in which all his powers and faculties are traced to natural sources, Hobbes 
asserts that the natural state of man in society would be one of war "a war of 
every man against every man." To avoid this anarchy the individual must yield up 
his rights to one supreme individual or body, the 'Leviathan,' which should have 
supreme power to dispose the state as it sees fit; and this absolutism in the state must 
extend also to the churck. This conclusion pleased neither the Puritans, who had 
overthrown King Charles, nor the Royalists, who believed that all rightful governments were divinely established. In deriving the power of a sovereign from an 
agreement made by the people Hobbes placed the ultimate power in their hands and 
thus prepared the way for the 'Social Contract' theory of the eighteenth century,
and for the French Revolution. The 'Leviathan' is noteworthy in an age of long 
periods and elaborate displays of erudition for the directness, concentration, and 
business-like plainness of its style. In the history of English thought it marks an 
important stage in the progress of naturalistic views.</summary>

under social and political law. It had been planned and written as a short essay in 
1854, and during the next three years it was enlarged into a volume, as the joint work 
of the author and his wife; but according to Mr. Mill's protestation, more her book 
than his. His own description of it is, that it is a philosophic text-book of this two-fold principle: (1) The importance, to man and society, of the existence of a large 
variety in types of character, the many different kinds of persons actually found where 
human nature develops all its possibilities; and (2) the further importance of giving 
full freedom of opinion and of development to individuals of every class and type. 
Mr. Mill thought he saw the possibility of democracy becoming a system of suppression of freedom, compulsion upon individuals to act and to think all in one way; a 
tyranny in fact of the populace, not less degrading to human nature and damaging 
to human progress than any of which mankind has broken the yoke. A reply to 
Mill's views was made by Sir J. F. Stephen in his 'Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality' 
(1874). Stephen attempted to so re-analyze and re-state the democratic ideas as to 
show that Mill's fears were needless. </summary>
  <summary author="Maeterlinck, Maurice (1862-1949)" title="The Life of the Bee" print_title="The Life of the Bee">LIFE OF THE BEE, THE ('La Vie des Abeilles'), a literary description of the social 
life of bees, by Maurice Maeterlinck, was published in 1901. An English translation 
by Alfred Sutro, to whom the work was dedicated, appeared in 1902. The author is 
familiar with all the scientific literature of bees and is himself an experienced apiculturist, but in this book he aims to present the facts not in the arid manner of the 
matter-of-fact scientist or writer of practical directions but with such literary charm 
as to bring out the romantic, poetic, and picturesque aspects of the subject and to 
show its appeal to the scientific and philosophic imagination. This end he accomplishes without any sacrifice of scientific truth and accuracy, all of his details being 
precise and proven fact being sharply distinguished from "pathetic fallacy." A 
meditative preface, 'At the Threshold of the Hive,' discusses the literature, general 
outlines, and philosophic bearings of the subject. 'The Swarm' traces the life of a 
hive from early spring to the establishment of a new colony. 'The Foundation of the 
City' describes the construction of the new home and the functions of the queen, 
workers, and drones. 'The Young Queens' pictures the rivalry between the queens, 
the elder of whom destroy the younger unless restrained by the workers in the interest 
of new colonies, and the process of parthenogenesis by which the queen lays eggs 
which develop only male bees or drones. In 'The Nuptial Flight' is described the 
remarkable union of one male bee and the queen. It can take place only at the summit 
of a lofty flight, where the queen is overtaken by the strongest male; it is immediately 
followed by the death of the male; and it suffices to fecundate the queen for life, 
enabling her to lay thousands of eggs which produce males, females, and workers. 
'The Massacre of the Males' shows how the drones, useless encumbrances after the 
fertilization of the queen, are ruthlessly killed by the workers; and how the bees 
hibernate. The last chapter, 'The Progress of the Species,' is devoted to a demonstration of the thesis that bees have not a mere mechanical instinct but an active 
intelligence and are capable of material and social progress. The whole book is an 
admirable union of scientific accuracy and literary grace.</summary>
  <summary author="Twain, Mark (1835-1910)" title="Life on the Mississippi" print_title="Life\non the\nMississippi">LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI, by Mark Twain (1883), is in part an autobiographic 
account of the author's early life, during which he learned and practiced a pilot's 
profession on the river, wholly unconscious of the literary channels in which his later 
course would be steered. It is prefaced by a graphic description of the mighty 
Mississippi, its history, its discovery by La Salle and others, and its continuous and 
wonderful change of bed, so that "nearly the whole one thousand three hundred 
miles which La Salle floated down in his canoes is good solid ground now." He relates his boyish ambition to be a steamboat-man, and how he attained it. His 
descriptions of his training and experiences before he became a full-fledged pilot are 
as characteristic and unique in handling as is the subject itself, which covers a long-vanished phase of Western life. The second half of the book recounts a trip made 
by the author through the scenes of his youth for the purposes of the work and the 
acquirement of literary materials: he enumerates the changes in men, manners, and 
places, which the intervening twenty years have brought about, and intersperses the 
whole with many lively digressions and stories, comments upon foreign tourists 
(Captain Hall, Mrs. Trollope, Captain Marryat, Dickens, and others); Southern 
vendettas; a thumbnail story, probably the nucleus of 'Pudd'nhead Wilson '; 'Murel's 
Gang'; the "fraudulent penitent"; and others. The book is especially valuable as 
the author's personal record of an epoch in the country's growth which has now 
passed into history.</summary>
  <summary author="Arnold, Edwin, Sir (1832-1904)" title="The Light of Asia" print_title="The Light of Asia">LIGHT OF ASIA, THE, by Sir Edwin Arnold (1878). 'The Light of Asia' is a 
poetic exposition in eight books of the Hindoo theology. "It was," the author says, 
"inspired by an abiding desire to aid in the better mutual knowledge of East and 
West." Through the medium of a devout Buddhist, Arnold presents the life of the 
young Gautama, living in princely joy, shielded from every care and pain. He 
develops the wistfully dreamy character of the young prince into the loftiness of the 
noble, loving Buddha, who "cast away the world to save the world." The religious 
teaching is merely indicated, because of the limitations of the laws of poetry and the 
sacrifice of philosophical details to dramatic effect. 

The Buddha of Arnold teaches that the way to attain Nirvana, the highest desire 
of every soul, is through four truths. The first truth is Sorrow: "Life which ye 
prize is long-drawn agony." The second truth is Sorrow's Cause: "Grief springs of 
desire." The third truth is Sorrow's Ceasing. The fourth truth is the way, by an 
eightfold path, "To peace and refuge"; to Nirvana, the reward of him who vanquishes the ten great sins. Nirvana, according to the poet, is not annihilation. It is 
the calm sinless state reached, by the suppression of all fond desires, through an 
existence continually renewed according to the law of Karma. The poem, which 
was published in 1878, is rich in sensuous Oriental pictures and imagery. It has been 
translated into many languages, both European and Asiatic; and has done much to 
create an interest in the religion of Buddha. 

In 1890 appeared 'The Light of the World,' written, it was said, to silence the 
criticism that Buddha was Christ under another name, and to show the essential 
differences in the teachings of the two. The story follows the historical life of Jesus. 
It is divided into five sections, each of which sets forth a special aspect of the divine 
life. Despite its Oriental setting, the character of Christ remains simple and dignified. 
Like its predecessor, the book quickly became a popular favorite.</summary>
  <summary author="Kipling, Rudyard (1865-1936)" title="The Light That Failed" print_title="The Light That Failed">LIGHT THAT FAILED, THE, by Rudyard Kipling, appeared in 1890, and was his 
first novel. It is a story of the love of Dick Heldar, a young artist, for Maisie, a 
pretty, piquant, but shallow girl, brought up with him as an orphan. Dick goes to 
the Soudan during the Gordon relief expedition, does illustrations for the English 
papers, gains a true friend in Torpenhow, a war correspondent; and winning success, 
returns to London to enjoy it. But a sword-cut on his head, received in the East, 
gradually brings on blindness; and he tries heroically to finish his masterpiece, a 
figure of Melancholia, before the darkness shuts down, the scene in which he thus 
works against the physical disability which means ruin, being very effective. When 
blindness comes, he is too proud to let Maisie know; but Torpenhow fetches her, and 
she shows the essential weakness of her nature by not standing by him when he is 
down in the world. Heart-broken, he returns to the British army in the East, and is 
killed as he sits on a camel fully exposed to the enemy's fire, as he desired to be. The 
sketch of the early friendship and love of Dick and Maisie, the vivid scenes in the 
Soudan, the bohemian studio life in London, and the pathetic incidents of Heldar's 
misfortune, are portrayed with swift movement, sympathetic insight, and dramatic 
force. The relation between Dick and Torpenhow runs through the tale like a golden 
strand. The denouement here described is that of the first version, and preferred 
by Kipling; in another version Maisie remains true to Dick, and the novel ends 
happily.</summary>
  <summary author="Williamson, C. N. (Charles Norris) (1859-1920); Williamson, A. M. (Alice Muriel) (1869-1933)" title="The Lightning Conductor" print_title="The Lightning Conductor">THE LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR, by C. N. and A. M. Williamson (1903). This 
is a lively and entertaining description of a tour through France and Italy in a motor 
car. The story is told in a series of letters emanating from the pens of the principal 
characters, namely Miss Molly Randolph and the Honorable John Winston. The 
former, a pretty and attractive American girl with a rich father, who provides her 
with an unlimited letter of credit, is traveling in Europe with her aunt, Miss Kedison, 
as chaperon. While in England Molly is inspired with the idea of possessing a motor 
car in which to tour through France, and buys a second-hand machine of Mr. Cecil 
Landstown, who gives her to understand that it is in fine condition. Delighted with 
her bargain, Molly provides her aunt and herself with automobile outfits, engages a 
chauffeur and sets forth on her travels. Her satisfaction, however, is but short-lived 
as the machine proves to be an utter failure and accidents and catastrophes follow 
each other in rapid succession. The chauffeur proves incompetent and disagreeable 
and finally goes off to purchase a new crank for the machine with a five-hundred-franc 
note and never returns. At this point the Honorable John Winston, who is touring 
the same country in his new "Napier," is strongly attracted by the "beauty in
distress," and wishing to keep near her, offers his services as chauffeur and is accepted. 
Under the name of Brown he proves a most valuable and efficient guide and is 
dubbed the "Lightning Conductor" by his vivacious mistress. A Frenchman 
named Talleyrand comes upon the scene and in order to get Molly to continue her 
journey in his automobile sets fire to her machine and destroys it. His deed is discovered, he is dismissed by Molly, and Brown substitutes his beloved "Napier" 
which he claims his late master, Mr. Winston, is desirous of renting. After a series of 
exciting and entertaining adventures the denouement finally comes, Brown's real 
identity is revealed, and Molly forgives his deception and listens favorably to his 
declaration of love.</summary>
  <summary author="Wister, Owen (1860-1938)" title="Lin McLean" print_title="Lin McLean">LIN MCLEAN, by Owen Wister (1897). This volume contains six sketches and a 
short poem; and in each of them the "charming cowboy," as the Vassar girls call 
him, is the central figure. The scene is laid in Wyoming "in the happy days when it 
was a Territory with a future, instead of a State with a past." Lin McLean is a 
brave boy and a manly man, who does right from inherent goodness, not because he is 
afraid of the law; and he is successful, whether he is trying to rope a steer or win a 
sweetheart. He has his troubles, too, but rises above them all, his imperturbable 
good-nature being a ready ally. The chapters are sketches, primarily, for those who 
are tired of the pavements and brick walls of cities; the air breathes of summer, and 
the little cabin on Box Elder is like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. The 
most noteworthy of these sketches is 'A Journey in Search of Christmas'; others are 
'How Lin McLean Went East'; 'The Winning of the Biscuit-Shooter'; 'Lin McLean's 
Honeymoon'; 'Separ's Vigilante'; and 'Destiny at Drybone.'</summary>
  <summary author="Charnwood, Godfrey Rathbone Benson, Baron (1864-1945)" title="Abraham Lincoln" print_title="Abraham Lincoln">LINCOLN, ABRAHAM, by Lord Charnwood (1916), published in the Makers of the 
Nineteenth Century Series. This "first considered attempt by an Englishman to
give a picture of Lincoln" is the most successful interpretation of Hs character yet 
presented. Its originality lies in the perspective view probably impossible to an 
American writer. Lord Charnwood is an admirer of Lincoln, whom he ranks as one 
of the greatest men of our time, but he depicts with full candor the crudities and 
faults in his hero. He describes the frontier life of which he was a product, his 
originality of mind and persistent self-training, and the gradual development of a 
rare character, and its adaption to great events and demands, until his leadership is 
recognized by his country and he bears "on his shoulders such a weight of care and 
pain as few other men have borne." Writing for English readers, the author summarizes American history and conditions in order to give background to the biography. The second chapter traces the growth of the American nation through 
Colonial days, the Revolution, and the War of 1812, and discusses the Missouri 
Compromise, and leaders, parties, and tendencies in Lincoln's youth. He dwells at 
length upon the Lincoln and Douglas debates which brought Lincoln into prominence. 
A later chapter is devoted to Secession, and the case of the South against the Union. 
The last half of the book is the history of the Civil War. He discusses English opinion at the time of the war, regretting the " powerlessness to comprehend another 
country and a self-sufficiency in judging it" and explains that the case of the North 
was not apprehended. England was actuated by a "sincere belief that the cause of 
the North was hopeless and that intervention . . . might prove the course of honest 
friendship to all America." The British working people were persistently on the 
side of the North. Aside from the politicians for and against the war, Darwin and 
Tennyson are known to have taken the Northern cause to heart. Dickens, who 
hated slavery and "who in 'Martin Chuzzlewit' had appealed, however bitterly, to 
the higher national spirit which he thought latent in America, now, when that spirit 
had at last and indeed asserted itself, gave way in his letters to nothing but hatred 
of the whole country." Lincoln's claim to universal interest Lord Charnwood 
believes is that "he elected to right the war not so much to preserve the United States 
government as because he believed that the preservation of that government was 
necessary to the triumph of democracy." His greatest deed "was the keeping of the 
North together in an enterprise so arduous, and an enterprise for objects so confusedly 
related as the Union and freedom." "He had been able to free the slaves, partly 
because he would not hasten to this object at the sacrifice of what he thought a 
larger purpose." He wrote before his presidency, "As I would not be a slave so I 
would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy." Full credit is given 
to Lincoln's administrative genius in his conduct of affairs, his recognition of public 
opinion, and the necessity of trusting subordinates, his neglect of the lesser for the 
greater, and his inflexibility on essentials. Lord Charnwood includes war strategy 
as one of the subjects on which Lincoln exercised a masterly guidance. His picture 
of Lincoln is a convincing portrait of a forceful and charming personality, and a 
great statesman.</summary>
  <summary author="Curtis, George William (1824-1892)" title="Literary and Social Essays" print_title="Literary and Social Essays">LITERARY AND SOCIAL ESSAYS, by George William Curtis. The nine essays 
which compose this volume were collected from several sources, and published in 
book form in 1895. Written with all the exquisite finish, the lucidity and grace which
characterized every utterance of Mr. Curtis, these essays are like an introduction 
into the actual presence of the gifted men of our century in whose splendid circle the 
author was himself at home. Emerson, Hawthorne, and the placid pastoral Concord 
of their homes, are the subjects of the first three chapters and are treated with the 
fine power of apt distinction, with the richness of rhetoric and the play of delicate 
humor, which those who heard Mr. Curtis remember, and those who know him only 
in his published works must recognize. To lovers of Emerson and Hawthorne these 
chapters will long be a delight, written as they were while the companionship of 
which they spoke was still warm and fresh in the author's memory. 

Equally interesting and valuable as contributions to the biography of American 
letters are the chapters on Oliver Wendell Holmes, Washington Irving, and Longfellow. Perhaps no one has given us more intimately suggestive portrait-sketches 
of the personalities of these familiar authors than are given in these collected essays. 
Particularly interesting to American readers are the occasional reminiscences of 
personal participation in scenes, grave or humorous, where the actors were all makers 
of history for New England. The book contains Mr. Curtis's brilliant essay on the 
famous actress Rachel, which appeared in Putnam's Magazine, 1855; a delightful 
sketch of Thackeray in America, from the same source; and a hitherto unpublished 
essay on Sir Philip Sidney, which is instinct with the author's enthusiasm for all that 
is strong and pure and truly gentle.</summary>
  <summary author="Leacock, Stephen (1869-1944)" title="Literary Lapses" print_title="Literary Lapses">LITERARY LAPSES, by Stephen Leacock (1910). A collection of humorous 
sketches: 'Boarding-House Geometry,' the postulates and axioms of this story are 
reprinted in THE LIBRARY; 'How to Live to be 200,' 'How to Avoid Getting Married,' 
'Men who have Shaved me,' 'Insurance up to Date,' 'Borrowing a Match,' etc. 
One of the most amusing is 'My Financial Career,' the experience of a shy young 
man who decides to deposit his fifty dollars a month salary in a bank. In ' Number 
Fifty-Six ' a Chinese laundryman, a second Sherlock Holmes, deducts the character 
and history of a man from study of his weekly wash, a logical biography but unfortunately absurdly mistaken. 'A New Pathology' takes up the powerful reaction of 
clothes on the wearer, and the diagnosis and treatment of such common diseases as 
"Contractio Pantalunae; or Shortening of the Legs of the Trousers," the painful 
malady of growing youth, and "Inflatio Genu; or, Bagging of the Knees of the Trousers," in which "the patient shows an aversion to the standing posture." The 
author's advice to those who fear germs and bacilli is: "If one flies into your room, 
strike at it with your hat or with a towel. Hit it as hard as you can between the 
neck and the thorax. It will soon get sick of that." "A, B, and C" are the heroes 
of the "short stories of adventures and industry with the end omitted" we meet as 
John, William, and Henry in early chapters of the arithmetic, and who conceal their 
identity as X, Y, and Z later in problems of algebra. These delightful absurdities 
are the ' Literary Lapses ' of a professor of economics.</summary>
  <summary author="Dickens, Charles (1812-1870)" title="Little Dorrit" print_title="Little Dorrit">LITTLE DORRIT, by Charles Dickens, was published 1856-57, when the author's 
popularity was at its height. The plot is a slight one on which to hang more than 
fifty characters. The author began with the intention of emphasizing the fact that 
individuals brought together by chance, if only for an instant, continue henceforth 
to influence and to act and react upon one another. But this original motive is soon 
altogether forgotten in the multiplication of characters and the relation of their 
fortunes. The central idea is to portray the experiences of the Dorrit family, immured 
for many years on account of debt in the old Marshalsea Prison, and then unexpectedly restored to wealth and freedom. Having been pitiable in poverty, they 
become arrogant and contemptible in affluence. Amy, "Little Dorrit," alone remains pure, lovable, and self-denying. In her, Dickens embodies the best human 
qualities in a most beautiful and persuasive form. She enlists the love of Arthur 
Clennam, who meantime has had his own trials. Returning from India, after long 
absence, he finds his mother a religious fanatic, domineered over by the hypocritical 
old Flintwinch, and both preyed upon by the Mephistophelian Blandois, perhaps 
the most dastardly villain in the whole Dickens gallery. The complications, however, 
end happily for Arthur and Amy. The main attack of the book is aimed against 
official "red tape" as exemplified in the Barnacle family and the "Circumlocution 
Office." It also shows up Merdle the swindling banker, "Bar, " " Bishop, " and other 
types of "Society." The Meagleses are "practical" people with soft hearts; their 
daughter is married to and bullied by Henry Gowan, whose mother is a genteel 
pauper at Hampton Court. Other characters are Pancks the collector, "puffing
like a steam-engine," his hypocritical employer Casby, the humble and worthy 
Plornishes, the love-blighted and epitaphic young John Chivery, and the wonderful 
Mr. F.'s aunt with her explosive utterances.</summary>
  <summary author="Barrie, J. M. (James Matthew) (1860-1937)" title="The Little Minister" print_title="The Little Minister">LITTLE MINISTER, THE, by J. M. Barrie. (1891). A love story, the scene 
of which is laid in the little Scotch weaving village of Thrums at about the 
middle of the last century. Aside from its intrinsic interest, there is much skilful 
portrayal of the complexities of Scotch character, and much sympathy with the 
homely lives of the poverty-stricken weavers, whose narrow creed may make them 
cruel, but never dishonorable. The hero, Gavin Dishart, is a boy preacher of twenty-one, small of stature but great in authority, and given to innocent frolic in exuberant 
moments. Grouped about him are his people, who watch him with lynx-eyed vigilance, ready to adore, criticize, and interfere; while an all-pervasive influence is the 
mother love and worship of "soft-faced" Margaret Dishart. 

Across the narrow path of the Little Minister, and straight into his orthodox 
life, dances Babbie the Egyptian, in a wild gipsy frock, with red rowans in her hair. 
Against the persuasiveness of her beautiful eyes and her madcap pranks, even three 
scathing sermons against Woman, preached by Gavin in self-defense, are of no avail; 
and the reader follows with absorbed interest his romantic meetings with the reprehensible Babbie, and the gossip of the scandalized community. The rapid unfolding 
of the story reveals Babbie's sorrowful and unselfish renunciation of Gavin, and her 
identity as the promised bride of Lord Rintoul, who is many years her senior. A false 
report of Gavin's death brings the lovers together again on the eve of Babbie's marriage. Fearing pursuit, she consents to a hasty gipsy marriage with Gavin in the 
woods; and the climax is reached when a flash of lightning reveals the ceremony to 
Lord Rintoul, two stern elders of the Kirk, and Rob Dow, who is seeking to save the 
Little Minister from his wrathful people by killing the Egyptian. In the flood that 
follows, the chief actors in this dramatic scene are scattered; but Gavin and Babbie, 
after many adventures, are reunited, a deed of heroism on the part of the Little 
Minister having reinstated him in the love of his people. 

The story is recounted by Dominie Ogilvy, who is at last revealed as the father of 
Gavin. It is lighted by touches of quaint humor that soften what might otherwise 
seem stern and forbidding in the picture. An instance in point is that of Tibbie
Craik, who would be "fine pleased" with any bride that the minister might choose, 
because she "had a magenta silk, and so was jealous of no one." 

In 1897 the book was dramatized, with a violent wrenching of the plot to meet 
dramatic necessities. </summary>
  <summary author="Van Dyke, Henry (1852-1933)" title="Little Rivers: A Book of Essays in Profitable Idleness" print_title="Little Rivers:\nA Book of Essays\nin\nProfitable Idleness">LITTLE RIVERS, by Rev. Henry Van Dyke, D.D. (1895), breathes the very spirit 
of wholesome pleasure. The book is called a record of profitable idleness, and describes the author's wanderings with rod and line, exploring the Adirondack woods, 
canoeing along the silver streams of Canada to the music of the old French ballads 
sung by the guides, tramping the heathery moors of historic Scotland, following the 
fir-covered banks of the Austrian Traun, and trying casts in the clear green lakes of 
the Tyrol. Dr. Van Dyke has heard of people who, like Wordsworth, feel a passion 
for the sea or the mountains; but for his part he would choose a river. Like David's 
hart he pants for the water-brooks, and asks for nothing better than a quiet stream 
with shady banks, where trout are not too coy. He loves nature with the love of a 
poet and a close observer; the love of a man whose busy working-life is spent among 
bricks and mortar, but who has a country heart. When he was a little boy, he slipped 
away without leave one day, with a heavy old borrowed rod, and spent a long delightful afternoon in landing three tiny trout. Soon afterwards he was made happy by 
a rod of his own, and began to ply the streams with a zest that has never since failed. 
The good sport, the free, irresponsible, out-door life, and the beauty of wild nature 
are the subject-matter of the volume. Bird songs and falling waters are the music, 
and happy summer sunshine lights its pages. There is, says the author, very little 
useful information to be found here, and no criticism of the universe, but only a 
chronicle of plain pleasures, and friendly observation of men and things.</summary>
  <summary author="Fox, John (1863-1919)" title="The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come" print_title="The Little Shepherd\nof Kingdom Come">LITTLE SHEPHERD OF KINGDOM COME, THE, by John Fox, Jr. (1903). 
This is a story of Kentucky and the Civil War. It opens in the mountain region, 
where Chadwick Buford, a small boy of unknown antecedents, finds himself suddenly 
homeless through the death of the kind mountaineer and his wife, with whom he has 
lived. His only possession is a fine shepherd dog named Jack to whom he is devotedly 
attached, and with him for a companion he starts out in search of an abiding place. 
After much weary tramping he arrives at the settlement of Kingdom Come, where 
he is taken in and made welcome by a family named Turner. "Chad," as he is 
called, makes himself useful in tending the sheep and Jack shows his wonderful 
ability in that line. 

In the household is a pretty little girl named Melissa, an adopted waif, who 
forms a warm attachment for Chad. He goes to school and becomes the protege 
of the schoolmaster, Caleb Hazel, who appreciates his sterling qualities. While 
on a logging trip with the Turners and Hazel, Chad becomes separated from them 
and is left behind in the city of Lexington. 

He falls into the hands of Major Buford who becomes interested in his namesake 
and takes him to his home. 

There Chad becomes acquainted with the Deans, the Major's neighbors, and 
finds in Margaret, the daughter of the house, the ideal of his life. He soon finds out 
that his unknown pedigree causes him to be shunned by his companions, and, heart-broken, he steals away from the Major's house, and returns to the Mountains. 

Later the supposed blot upon his birth is removed. He is proved the Major's
kinsman, and returns to college and occupies his rightful position. He becomes 
engaged to Margaret, but with the opening of the Civil War feels that his duty is 
towards the Union and enlists in that Army, thereby estranging himself from both 
Margaret and the Major. His career during the war is one of brave deeds and 
generous actions, and he risks his life to save that of his enemy, Daniel Dean. Melissa 
makes a hazardous trip at night to warn Chad that his life is in danger, and dies 
later as a result of her exposure on that occasion. When peace is finally declared, 
Chad returns home a Major, all is forgiven, and he and Margaret are re-united. </summary>

English translation 1869). The story of this gloomy novel is not easily analyzed, 
but a bare statement of the plot would run thus: Maria Dmitrievna Kalitine, a 
rich widow living in a Russian provincial town, has a beautiful daughter Liza, who is 
deeply religious. Vladimir Nikolaevich Panshin, who pays court to her, is a young 
man with charming manners and an easy flow of egotistical talk. Presently appears
Fedor Ivanovich Lavretsky, a distant cousin of Maria Dmitrievna, who is known 
to live unhappily with his wife. Between his father, a despotic, narrow-minded egotist, and his aunt Glafira, a harsh, fierce old woman, Lavretsky's bringing-up has 
been a strange and solitary one; and at the age of twenty- three he naturally falls 
in love with the first pretty girl he sees, Varvara Pavlovna Korobine, whom 
he marries. As she detests Russia, they finally settle in Paris where he discovers 
her faithlessness and leaves her. Maria Dmitrievna receives him cordially, and 
he becomes a frequent visitor to the house. Little by little he and Liza fall in love; 
and upon the complications that thus arise, the interest of the story is founded. The 
difficult situations are skillfully managed, and the reader cannot resent the sadness 
of the tale as needless, because it results inevitably from the conditions. Like all 
Turgenev's books, the chief interest of 'Liza' lies in its study of character.</summary>
  <summary author="Bagehot, Walter (1826-1877)" title="Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market" print_title="Lombard Street:\nA Description\nof the\nMoney Market">LOMBARD STREET, 'A Description of the Money Market,' by Walter Bagehot, 
is a lucid exposition of the English banking system published in 1873. The Bank of 
England, the Private Banks, the Joint Stock Banks and the bill-brokers are considered 
in turn, the main features of the whole system explained, and the problems arising 
from them discussed. "Two fundamental ideas run through the whole of Mr. 
Bagehot 's book, of which the first is this: that it is wrong, unjust, and dangerous that 
the whole banking reserve of the kingdom should be kept in one bank, the Banking 
Department of the Bank of England. He points out in detail how all the country 
banks of Great Britain keep their cash resources in some one of the London banks, and 
how all of these London banks keep their cash resources with the Bank of England, 
so that the reserve of notes in this one institution constitutes the fund which must 
meet a sudden demand from all parts of the kingdom. . . . While admitting, however, the grave defects of the one reserve system as practised in England, Mr. Bagehot frankly states that it is useless to hope for or advocate any change. He treats 
the adoption of a many reserve system as wholly impracticable . . . confining him-self to the consideration of what should be the proper management of the single 
reserve in the Bank of England." (Gamaiel Bradford in North American Review, 
vol. cxix, October, 1874). The second fundamental idea is that in a time of panic 
it is the true policy of a reserve-holding bank to be liberal in granting loans and discounts and not to be too rigid hi scrutinizing security. Only thus can public confidence 
be maintained; otherwise the impression that money cannot be obtained will create a 
rush for money. The book is an admirable and rare example of business ability and 
experience united with literary skill, economic insight and the gift of clarity in 
exposition.</summary>
  <summary author="Besant, Walter (1836-1901)" title="London" print_title="London">LONDON, by Sir Walter Besant (1892, new ed. 1894), is a comprehensive survey 
of the metropolis of the modern world from the Roman days to those of George the 
Second. The material is of course well worn, but the skill of the writer's method and 
the freshness of his interest make it seem new. He begins his tale with the occupation 
of the Romans, who appreciating the value of the river Thames, picked out a dry 
hillock in the great stretches of marsh along the stream, and founded the town of 
Augusta, an isolated spot in the midst of fen and forest. After the Roman evacuation of Britain, no more is heard of Augusta; the town having been deserted or 
destroyed. It was a new settlement in the old spot that rose again to prosperity as 
Lud's Town. Prom the sixth century onward, the city, though ravaged by plagues, 
and more often by fires, always its bane, has grown steadily in population, wealth, 
and importance. Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman, Plantagenet, and at last English, 
it has always been a city of churches and palaces. Its burghers have always been 
free men, owning no lord but the king; and its mayors have rivaled great nobles in
power and splendor. Dick Whittington may not have made his fortune by selling a 
cat; but it is certain that when, as mayor of London, he entertained King Henry V., 
he burned 60,000 worth of royal bonds, as a little attention to royalty. The city's 
greatest mayor was Sir Thomas Gresham, who, in Elizabeth's Day, conceived the 
idea of transferring the center of the world's commerce from Antwerp to London, 
and to that end built the Royal Exchange. The record of each century is full of 
incident, story, and social changes. Mr. Besant is writing on a subject he loves, and 
spares no pains to lay before the reader a brilliant picture of the streets and buildings, 
businesses, customs, and amusements of the ever-flourishing, ever-changing city, now 
the great center of the financial, economical, and social world.</summary>
  <summary author="Johnston, Mary (1870-1936)" title="The Long Roll" print_title="The Long Roll">LONG ROLL, THE, by Mary Johnston (1911). This is the first of two books 
dealing with the Civil War, and opens out before the secession has taken place. The 
scene is laid in Virginia and the opening chapters show how generally opposed the 
people are to war and how they hope for the preservation of the Union. When war 
is declared, however, all the loyal Virginians put their state first, and enter upon the 
great struggle. The book contains many stirring descriptions of battles and skirmishes and shows the sufferings of the soldiers and of those left behind. The family 
of General Warwick Gary figure prominently in the story and he and his son Edward 
are among the first to volunteer. There are three daughters the most beautiful of 
whom is Judith, whose romance is shadowed by the sadness of war. She has two 
suitors, Richard Cleave and Maury Stafford; the former is the chosen one, while the 
latter filled with jealous rage vows vengeance on his rival. Both men are officers in
the Confederate army and during the conflict the moment comes when Stafford can 
gratify his evil desire. He is given a message by General Stonewall Jackson to convey 
to Colonel Cleave and he changes the order in such a manner that Cleave commits a 
great indiscretion which results in disaster to his troops. He is court-martialed, found 
guilty of disobedience to orders, and dismissed from the Army, a disgraced man. 
Though innocent of wrong-doing Cleave is unable to clear himself, as the man to 
whom Stafford gave the message to deliver verbally to him is dead. However, 
desirous of doing his duty against all odds Cleave changes his name and enlists as a 
gunner in the Artillery. Here he does notable service and is finally recognized by 
General Stonewall Jackson who has an explanation with him which clears up much 
that has been mysterious. The next day Jackson is shot in battle and subsequently 
dies, but before his death requests that Richard Cleave be given another trial. The 
story ends with the description of the funeral of Stonewall Jackson, the eccentric but 
beloved soldier, and the reader is convinced that Cleave's innocence will soon be 
acknowledged and that the faithful and devoted Judith who has been nursing the 
sick and wounded in the hospitals, will have her patience and loyalty rewarded.</summary>

tested by experience of the hardships of life at sea. He dreams of heroic deeds, but 
when the real crisis comes, panic seizes him, and he deserts the sinking ship with the 
other officers, leaving the eight hundred sleeping pilgrim passengers to their fate. 
The ship, by some miracle, keeps afloat, and is towed into Suez by a French man-of-war and its officers are disgraced. The issue of Jim's honor is for him beyond the 
decision of any court of inquiry. Another chance must come to let him prove himself 
the hero of his romantic imagination. He tries to make a fresh start, but the wretched 
story follows him everywhere. Finally he accepts the position of trader in a remote 
Malay village, where as adviser, practically chief, he is loved, trusted, and admired 
by a savage tribe. By courage and self-sacrifice, he feels he has mastered his fate, 
and atoned for his moment of cowardice. Unfortunately his people endow him with 
supernatural power. He allows a band of pirates to go free after an attack on the 
village. They abuse his safe conduct, and kill the young son of Chief Dorian, his own 
closest friend. Instantly his prestige is gone. He is regarded as a devil who has 
brought about this dire misfortune. He refuses to fight for his life, leaves the girl he 
loves, and gives himself up to be shot by the aged Dorian. Descriptions of the calm 
moonlight night on the tropic sea in the "Patua" are quoted in the LIBRARY from

has been said of it; and it is Blackmore's special pride that as a native he has "satisfied natives with their home scenery, people, life, and language." But the popularity 
of the brilliant romance has not been local, and has been equally great on both sides 
of the Atlantic. Even without so swift a succession of exciting incident, the unhackneyed style, abounding in fresh simile, with its poetic appreciation of "the fairest 
county in England," combined with homely realism, would make it delightful reading. 
Much as Hardy acquaints us with Wessex, Blackmore impresses Exmoor upon us, 
with a comprehensive "Englishness" of setting and character. It is out-of-door 
England, with swift streams, treacherous bogs, dangerous cliffs, and free winds across 
the moors. The story is founded on legends concerning the robber Doones, a fierce 
band of aristocratic outlaws, who in revenge for wrongs done them by the government, 
lived by plundering the country-side. Regarding their neighbors as ignoble churls 
and their legitimate prey, they robbed and murdered them at will. John Ridd, when 
a lad of fourteen, falls into their valley by chance one day, and is saved from capture 
by Lorna Doone, the fairest, daintiest child he has ever seen. When he is twenty-one, 
and the tallest and stoutest youth on Exmoor, "great John Ridd" seeks Lorna again. 
He hates the Doones who killed his father, but he loves beautiful innocent Lorna; 
and becomes her protector against the fierce men among whom she lives. If slow to 
think, he is quick to act; if "plain and unlettered," he is brave and noble: and Lorna 
welcomes his placid strength. Scattered through the swift narration, certain scenes, 
such as Lorna 's escape to the farm, a tussle with the Doones, the attempted murder 
in church, the final duel with Carver Doone, and others, stand out as great and glowing pictures.</summary>
  <summary author="Freytag, Gustav (1816-1895)" title="The Lost Manuscript: A Novel" print_title="The Lost Manuscript:\nA Novel">LOST MANUSCRIPT, THE ('Die verlorene Handschrift') by Gustav Freytag (1865). 
The scene of this strong and delightful story is laid in Germany towards the middle 
of this century. A young but very learned philologist, Professor Felix Werner, goes 
with his friend Fritz Halm, also a learned man, in search of a lost manuscript of 
Tacitus, to the castle of Bielstein, near Rossau, where he supposed it to have been 
hidden by the monks in the sixteenth century. Though the quest is for the moment 
fruitless as regards the manuscript, the professor finds in Use, the beautiful fair-haired daughter of the proprietor of the castle, a high-minded and noble woman. 
He brings her home as his wife. Werner is professor at the university; and Use, 
though brought up among such different surroundings, adapts herself readily to her 
new life, and becomes very popular among her husband's colleagues and with the 
students. The reigning sovereign, hearing of Use's charms, invites the professor to
pass, with his wife, some weeks at the palace; offering, as an inducement, all the aid 
in his power towards finding the missing manuscript. The invitation is accepted, and 
all at first goes well. Use is not long, however, in perceiving that while her husband 
is treated with marked distinction, she is shunned by the ladies of the court, the 
sovereign alone singling her out by his too marked attentions. Her position is 
equivocal. Werner, however, intent only upon his manuscript, is blind to the danger 
of his wife. During a temporary absence of her husband, Use, to save her honor, 
escapes to Bielstein. The professor, returning, misses his wife, and follows her in hot 
haste, and they are >appily reunited. All hope of finding the manuscript proves 
vain, and the professor realizes with remorse that while pursuing this wild quest, he 
has risked losing what was dearest to him. The book is lightened by a humorous 
account of the hostility between two rival hat-makers: Herr Hummel, the professor's 
landlord, and Herr Halm, the father of Fritz Halm, who lives directly opposite. There 
is a subordinate love affair between Fritz Halm and Laura Hummel, the son and 
daughter of the rival houses, ending in marriage. The story, if not the most brilliant 
of Freytag's telling, is yet graphic and entertaining, and is a great favorite in Germany.</summary>
  <summary author="Disraeli, Benjamin, Earl of Beaconsfield (1804-1881)" title="Lothair" print_title="Lothair">LOTHAIR, by Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield (1870). The scene of this 
extravagant, but at the same time remarkable, story is laid chiefly in England about 
1570, at the time when it was published. 

The hero, Lothair, a young nobleman of wide estates and great wealth, is introduced a short time before the attainment of his majority. Brought up under the 
influence of his uncle, Lord Culloden, "a member of the Free Kirk," he has been 
surrounded by a Protestant atmosphere. When, in accordance with his father's will, 
he goes to Oxford to complete his education, his other guardian, Cardinal Grandison, 
determines to bring him into the Roman Church. 

The story is a graphic description of the struggles of rival ecclesiastics, statesmen, 
and leaders of society to secure the adherence of the young nobleman. 

On a visit to the ducal seat of Brentham, the home of Lothair's college friend 
Bertram, he falls in love with Bertram's sister, Lady Corisande, and asks for her 
hand, but is refused by her mother. 

Lothair next comes under the influence of Lord and Lady St. Jerome, and Miss
Arundel. Charmed with the beauty and peace of their life, he is almost won over 
to the Romanist side. At the critical moment he meets Theodora, the wife of Colonel 
Campian, an American, "a gentleman, not a Yankee; a gentleman of the South, who 
has no property but land." Theodora is an Italian but not a Romanist, and the 
scale is turned toward the Protestant side. Colonel and Mrs. Campian are friends 
of Garibaldi; and through them Lothair is inspired to join the campaign of 1867 
against the papal forces. He is severely wounded at Montana, and is nursed back to 
health by Miss Arundel, who by degrees re-establishes her influence over him. Again 
he is saved by Theodora, who appears to him in a vision and reminds him of the 
promise given to her on her death-bed, that he will never join the church of Rome. 

By a desperate effort, Lothair escapes the vigilance of his Romanist friends, and 
after travels in the East returns to London. 

A second visit to Brentham renews his deep admiration for Lady Corisande, whose 
love he succeeds in winning. 

The narrative of 'Lothair' never lags or lacks movement. The intervals between the adventures are filled with witty sketches of English society and portraits 
of English personalities. The character of Lord St. Aldegonde is perhaps the happiest 
of these. "When St. Aldegonde was serious, his influence over men was powerful." 
He held extreme opinions on political affairs. "He was opposed to all privilege and 
to all orders of men except dukes, who were a necessity. He was also strongly in 
favor of the equal division of all property except land. Liberty depended on land, 
and the greater the land-owners the greater the liberty of a country." "St. Aldegonde had married for love, but he was strongly in favor of woman's rights and their 
extremest consequences."</summary>
  <summary author="Reade, Charles (1814-1884)" title="Love Me Little, Love Me Long" print_title="Love Me Little,\nLove Me Long">LOVE ME LITTLE, LOVE ME LONG (1857). In this story, Charles Reade 
turned away from his wonted exposition of social abuses to write a love story, 
pure and simple. It is a pleasant study of upper middle-class English life. Lucy 
Fountain, a young heiress, has two guardians, her uncle Mr. Fountain, and 
Mr. Bazalgette, the husband of her mother's half-sister; and she divides the year 
between their two homes. She is pretty, charming, and useful; and both Uncle 
Fountain and Aunt Bazalgette want to establish her close at hand by choosing a 
husband for her. But Lucy is indifferent both to Mr. Hardy, the banker selected by 
her aunt, and Mr. Talboys, the man of ancient lineage who is favored by her uncle. 
She falls in love with David Dodd, a manly young sailor in the merchant service, 
who loves her, but who recognizes her social superiority, while he is forced to admit 
that his Lucy is freakish, now kind, now cold. To escape importunity at home, she 
runs away and stays with her old nurse, where David discovers and wins her. They 
have a few blissful weeks together before David sails on the Rajah, of which through 
Lucy's influence he has been made captain. The story is simple, but full of homely 
incident, clever dialogue, shrewd character-drawing, and overflowing humor. With 
its sequel, 'Very Hard Cash,' it is considered among the best of Reade's novels. 
Lucy herself is the type of woman oftenest drawn by Reade, pretty, emotional, 
noble at heart, but given to coquettish deceits and uncertain moods, until steadied 
by love.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Love's Labour's Lost" print_title="Love's Labour's Lost">LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST is one of Shakespeare's early dramatic productions, 
written about 1588 or '89, and has all the marks of immature style; yet its repartees 
and witticisms give it a sprightly cast, and its constant good-humor and good-nature 
make it readable. The plot, as far as is known, is Shakespeare's own. There is an 
air of unreality about it, as if all the characters had eaten of the insane root, or were 
at least light-headed with champagne. Incessant are their quick venues of wit, 
"snip, snap, quick, and home." In a nutshell, the play is a satire of Utopias, of all 
thwarting of natural instincts. Ferdinand, King of Navarre, and his three associate 
lords, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville, have taken oath to form themselves into a kind 
of monastic academy for study. They swear to fast, to eat but one meal a day, and 
for three years not to look on the face of woman; all of which "is flat treason against 
the kingly state of youth." But, alas! the King had forgotten that he was about to 
see the Princess of France and three of her ladies, come on a matter of State business. 
However, he will not admit them into his palace, hut has pavilions pitched in the 
park. At the first glance all four men fall violently in love, each with one of the 
ladies, the king with the princess, Biron with Rosaline, etc.: Cupid has thumped 
them all "with his bird-bolt under the left pap." They write sentimental verses, 
and while reading them aloud in the park, all find each other out, each assuming a 
stern severity with the perjured ones until he himself is detected. One of the humorous characters is Don Adriano de Armado, "who draweth out the thread of his 
verbosity finer than the staple of his argument." In him, and in the preposterous 
pedant Holofernes, and the curate Sir Nathaniel, the poet satirizes the euphuistic 
affectations of the time, the taffeta phrases, three-piled hyperboles, and foreign 
language scraps, ever on the tongues of these fashionable dudes. The "pathetical 
nit," Moth, is Armado 's page, a keen-witted rogueling. Dull is a constable of 
"twice-sodden simplicity," and Costard the witty clown. Rosaline is the Beatrice 
of the comedy, brilliant and caustic in her wit. Boyet is an old courtier who serves as 
a kind of usher or male lady's-maid to the princess and her retinue. The loves of 
the noblesse are parodied in those of Costard and of the country wench Jaquenetta. 
The gentlemen devise, to entertain the ladies, a Muscovite masque and a play by the 
clown and pedants. The ladies get wind of the masque, and, being masked themselves, guy the Muscovites who go off "all drybeaten with pure scoff"; Rosaline 
suggests that maybe they are sea-sick with coming from Muscovy. The burlesque 
play tallies that in 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' the great folk making satirical 
remarks on the clown's performances. Costard is cast for Pompey the Huge, and it 
transpires that the Don has no shirt on when he challenges Costard to a duel. While 
the fun is at its height comes word that sobers all: the princess's father is dead. As a
test of their love the princess and Rosaline impose a year's severe penance on their 
lovers, and if their love proves true, promise to have them; and so do the other ladies 
promise to their wooers. Thus love's labor is, for the present, lost. The comedy ends 
with two fine lyrics, the cuckoo song ('Spring'), and the 'Tu-whit, tu-whoo' song 
of the owl ( Winter').</summary>
  <summary author="Rice, Alice Caldwell Hegan (1870-1942)" title="Lovey Mary" print_title="Lovey Mary">LOVEY MARY, by Alice Hegan Rice (1903). This story continues the experience of 
"Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch," and is written im the same entertaining vein. 
A new heroine, however, is introduced in the person of "Lovey Mary," who having 
begun life as a foundling, has spent her first fifteen years in a "Home." She has 
never known anything but rebuffs and cold treatment, and longs for affection and 
some of the good things of life. Her first real pleasure is derived from taking care of a 
child named Tommy, who is brought to the Home by his wayward mother Kate 
Rider, who has been a previous inmate. Lovey Mary, who has a deep aversion for 
Kate who has treated her unkindly in the past, is at first much opposed to the child 
who is put in her charge but soon overcomes this feeling and grows to love him 
passionately. After two years of devotion during which time Tommy has grown to 
return some of the affection which Lovey Mary lavishes upon him, she discovers that
Kate is planning to take her child and decides to prevent this calamity. Accordingly 
she slips away at early dawn with Tommy in her arms and at the end of a fruitless 
day finds herself at the "Cabbage Patch." Here she is met by the kind-hearted Mrs. 
Wiggs who immediately sets about making her comfortable. It is decided that she 
shall take up her location with Miss Hazy, a shiftless individual who is helped along 
in her struggles for existence by the inmates of the "Patch." Lovey Mary finds 
work in the factory and restores Miss Hazy's untidy abode to cleanly conditions. 
The matron of the Home discovers the whereabouts of her missing charge but instead 
of making the fact known decides to let Lovey Mary continue in the course she has 
chosen. However, Lovey Mary who has a well-developed conscience feels she is not 
really justified in keeping Tommy from his mother and finally decides to restore 
him; she goes to Kate who is sick in the hospital and after a reconciliation takes her 
home and nurses her till she dies. The reader takes leave of Lovey Mary and Tommy 
as they are starting off on a trip with their kind friends the Reddings, life having 
assumed a brighter aspect for the heroine than she had ever deemed possible.</summary>

for their subjects strange incidents of life in the far West during the gold-fever of '49. 
The essential romance of that adventurous, lawless, womanless society is embodied 
in these tales. Representative members of it, gamblers "with the melancholy air 
and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet"; all-around scamps with blond hair and 
Raphael faces; men with pasts buried in the oblivion east of the Mississippi; young 
men, battered men, decayed college graduates, and ex-convicts, are brought together 
in picturesque confusion, their hot, fierce dramas being played against the loneliness of the Sierras, the aloofness of an unconquerable nature. 'The Luck of Roaring 
Camp' is perhaps the most beautiful of the sketches; 'The Outcasts of Poker Flat' 
is scarcely less pathetic. In 'Tennessee's Partner,' and in 'Miggles,' humor and 
pathos are mingled. The entire book is a wonderfully dramatic transcript of a phase 
of Western life forever passed away.</summary>
  <summary author="Wordsworth, William (1770-1850); Coleridge, Samuel Taylor (1772-1834)" title="Lyrical Ballads" print_title="Lyrical Ballads">LYRICAL BALLADS, a collection of lyrical poems, mainly by William Wordsworth, 
but including "The Ancient Mariner' and 'The Nightingale' by Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge, was first published in 1/98. A second edition, with corrections and 
additions and a famous preface by Wordsworth, appeared in 1800. As originally 
planned the volume was to have been the joint production of Coleridge and Wordsworth, the former treating supernatural themes in such a manner as to create poetic 
belief, and the latter investing common incidents with an atmosphere of wonder and 
imagination. Wordsworth's superior industry and Coleridge's indolence brought it 
about that with the brilliant exception of 'The Ancient Mariner' the volume was 
confined to the second of these two objects. In his preface Wordsworth upholds his 
choice of ordinary events and humble life on the ground of the greater emotional 
sincerity and the more beautiful natural background afforded by them; and he 
defends the plainness and baldness of his style and metre on the ground that the 
language of poetry should closely approximate to the language of everyday life and 
that metre is not essential to poetry. (For Coleridge's criticism of these opinions, 
which are a natural reaction from the conventionality of eighteenth-century poetic 
diction, see the digest of his 'Biographia Literaria'.) Many of the 'Lyrical Ballads' 
like 'Anecdote for Fathers, ' 'Simon Lee/ 'The Idiot Boy,' 'We are Seven/ and 'Lucy 
Gray' incurred ridicule through their simple ballad metre, the prosaic matter-of-factness of their expression, and the absence of externally striking incidents and 
climaxes; yet each of these poems, if sympathetically read, stirs the imagination and 
emotions of the reader and awakens him to the spiritual significance of the humblest 
and most commonplace events. More arresting but still simple in treatment are 
those rural tragedies 'Goody Blake/ 'The Thorn,' and 'Ruth. 1 The landscape 
beauty of the Lake District and the simple dignity of a humble life lived close to 
nature appears in 'The Old Cumberland Beggar' and in 'Michael,' both in blank 
verse. Vhe poet's early love of his native dales, his moods of mystical insight, and 
his ties of kinship and affection are reflected in 'There was a Boy,' 'Nutting, ' and 
'Influence of Natural Objects' (all in blank verse, afterwards included in the 'Prelude'), 'Tintern Abbey 1 (a magnificent hymn to the immanent presence in nature), 
the address to his sister, Dorothy, in the same poem and in others, the Matthew 
poems dedicated to an old friend and the exquisite Lucy-poems, lamenting the loss of 
a real or ideal love, who had grown up under the influences of nature. Coleridge's 
'Ancient Mariner' by a marvelous tour de force creates and endows with reality a 
succession of fantastic adventures in the South Seas, involving a sailor who has 
incurred the enmity of the elemental spirits by killing an albatross. Spell-bound by 
the poet's consummate art we follow the mariner's punishment and purgation with a 
painful interest and a temporary conviction of reality; and are meanwhile delighted 
by a series of marvelous pictures, horrible and exquisite in turn. The ' Lyrical 
Ballads ' began a new era in English poetry. They stirred contemporary writers to 
throw off the last restraints of conventional diction and to draw from the springs of 
sentiment, feeling, and imagination.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Macbeth" print_title="Macbeth">MACBETH, Shakespeare's great tragedy of ambition and retribution, was written 
about 1606. The prose story used was found in Holinshed's 'Chronicles.' The 
sombre passions of the soul are painted with a brush dipped in blood and darkness. 
In every scene there is the horror and redness of blood. The faces of the murdered 
King Duncan's guards are smeared with it, it stains the spectral robes of Banquo, 
flows from the wounds of the pretty children of Macduff, and will not off from the 
little hand of the sleep-walking Lady Macbeth. Banquo and Macbeth have just 
returned from a successful campaign in the north. On the road they meet three 
weird sisters, who predicted for Macbeth kingship, and for Banquo that his issue 
should be kings. 'Tis very late; the owl has shrieked good -night; only the lord and 
lady of the castle are awake. He, alone and waiting her signal, sees a vision of a 
phantasmal dagger in the air before him. He enters the chamber. "Hark! it was 
but the owl." "Who's there? what ho!" "I have done the deed: didst thou not 
hear a noise?" In the dead silence, as day dawns, comes now a loud knocking at the 
south entry, and the coarse grumbling of the half-awakened porter brings back the 
commonplace realities of the day. Macbeth is crowned at Scone. But his fears 
stick deep in Banquo, and at a state banquet one of his hired murderers whispers him 
that Banquo lies dead in a ditch outside. As he turns he sees the ghost of that nobleman in his seat. "Prithee, see there! behold! look!" "Avaunt! and quit my sight! 
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; thou hast no speculation in those eyes 
which thou dost glare with." "Gentlemen, rise, his Highness is not well." Macbeth, deep in crime, has no resource but to go deeper yet and becomes a bloody tyrant; 
but ends his career at Dunsinane Castle, where the slain king's sons, Malcolm and 
Macduff, and ten thousand stout English soldiers meet their friends the Scottish 
patriot forces. The tyrant is fortified in the castle. The witches have told him he 
shall not perish till Birnam wood shall come to Dunsinane, and that no one of woman 
born shall have mortal power over him. But the enemy, as they approach, cut 
branches from Birnam wood "to shadow the number of their host." This strikes 
terror to Macbeth 's heart; but relying on the other assurance of the witches, he rushes 
forth to battle. He meets the enraged Macduff, learns from him that he (Macduff) 
was ripped untimely from his mother's womb, and so is not strictly of woman born. 
With the energy of despair Macbeth attacks him, but is overcome and beheaded.</summary>
  <summary author="Flaubert, Gustave (1821-1880)" title="Madame Bovary" print_title="Madame Bovary">MADAME BOVARY, by Gustave Flaubert, appeared in 1856, when the author was 
thirty-five. It was his first novel, and is regarded as the book which founded the 
realistic school in modern French fiction, the school of Zola and Maupassant. 
The novel is a powerful, unpleasant study of the steps by which a married woman 
descends to sin, bankruptcy, and suicide. It is fatalistic in its teaching, Flaubert's 
theory of life being that evil inheres in the constitution of things. Madame Bovary,
a doctor's wife, has been linked to him without really loving him; he is honest, uninteresting, and adores her. Reared in a convent, her romanticism leads her to 
dream of a lover. She finds one, then another; spends money after the manner of a 
light woman; and when she has involved her husband in financial ruin, kills herself 
and leaves him to face a sea of troubles. The time is the first half of last century; 
the action takes place in provincial French towns. The merit of the novel lies in its 
truth in depicting the stages of this moral declension, the wonderful accuracy of 
detail, the subtle analysis of the passionate human heart. Technically, in point of 
style, it ranks with the few great productions of French fiction. It is sternly moral 
in the sense that it shows with unflinching touch the logic of the inevitable misery 
that follows the breaking of moral law.</summary>

Julien Viaud), appeared in 1887, when he was thirty-seven. It is the seventh of the 
novels in which Loti has tried to fix in words the color, atmosphere, and life of different countries. The scene of ' Madame Chrysantheme ' is Japan, and the reader sees 
and feels that strange land as Loti saw and felt it, a little land of little people and 
things; a land of prettiness and oddity rather than of beauty; where life is curiously 
free from moral and intellectual complexities. Loti has but a single theme, the 
isolated life of one man with one woman; but the charm of 'Madame Chrysantheme' 
is not in its romance. The pretty olive-hued wife whom the sailor Loti upon his 
arrival at Nagasaki engages at so much a month, conscientiously does her part. She 
pays him all reverence, keeps the house gay with Japanese blossoms, plays her harp, 
and is as Japanese a little oddity as he could find; but fails even to amuse him. She 
is as empty of ideality as her name-flower is of fragrance, or as the little apartment 
which he rents for her and for himself is of furniture. But the disillusion of Loti 
himself, the mocking pessimism underlying his eager appreciation of the new sense-impressions, and the exact touch and strong relief of his descriptions of exotic scenes, 
exercise a curious magnetism. </summary>
  <summary author="Sudermann, Hermann (1857-1928)" title="Magda: A Play in Four Acts" print_title="Magda:\nA Play in Four Acts">MAGDA ('Die Heimat'), by Hermann Sudermann (1893). The high spirited Magda 
has been driven from home by the tyranny of her father, an ex-soldier, who rules his 
household with military despotism. She has sinned and suffered and worked, and 
at the opening of the play, returns to the home of her girlhood, after an absence of 
many years, a famous opera star. The pastor, Magda 's rejected suitor, who still 
loves her, persuades her father to consent to receive her. She realizes that the free 
independent life of the artist has led her far beyond the petty bourgeois society and 
the commonplace family life, as well as the yoke of paternal authority. By mischance her father learns the secret of her past, and in a frenzy orders her to marry the 
father of her child, now a government councillor in the little town. The interview 
with her lover and her father is quoted in the LIBRARY. The former lover is willing 
enough to marry the rich woman and distinguished artist, and though she despises 
the man, Magda at first consents for love of her father and to give her son a name. 
When it transpires that the condition made is that she shall part from the child to 
avoid scandal, she spurns the marriage. The old soldier insists that the marriage 
shall take place to redeem the family honor. He threatens to take her life and his 
own if she persists in her refusal. In vain she tries to convince him that it is because 
she is now pure and true that she cannot act otherwise. As a last argument, she 
hints that she has had other lovers. As he is on the point of firing his pistol at her, 
he succumbs to apoplexy. Two types of conflict are presented, the struggle ot the 
individual against the accepted rules of conduct, and the struggle between individual 
self-respect and the conventional ideal of absolute contrition and self-abasement for 
sins committed; but the success of the play depends upon its well-contrived situations and the opportunity it offers to a gifted actress.</summary>

"own, " while fishing along the shores of Bristol Channel and Swansea Bay, finds 
in a drifting boat, which is carried by the seas into Pool Tavan, a wee two-year-old

"waif of the sea, " first known as "Bardie, " then Andalusia; and last proved by the 
true Bampfylde peculiarity of thumbs, to be Bertha, the long-lost daughter of that 
aristocratic family. Brave Commander Rodney Bluett's proud relations do not 
therefore object to his marriage with the heroine. The old veteran's description of 
naval engagements, and his quaint views of "the quality" (the story is a first-person 
narrative throughout), makes it intensely dramatic. The death and disinterment of
"Black Evan's" five sons, smothered in a sand-storm; the villainy of giant Parson 
Chowne, and his savage death from hydrophobia; and the honest love of the narrator 
for Lady Isabel Carey, are prominent factors in the development of the plot. It is 
to the latter that old Davy, describing "the unpleasantness of hanging," remarks, 
"I had helped, myself, to run nine good men up at the yard-arm. And a fine thing 
for their souls, no doubt, to stop them from more mischief, and Jet them go up while 
the Lord might think that other men had injured them." In another place 
he is made to admit, "If my equal insults me, I knock him down; if my officer does it, 
I knock under." These illustrations show something of the drollery of much of

to be his wife, his varied experiences in America as factory-workman, ship-laborer, 
and canvasser, with seasons of unemployment and tramp life, and his entrance into 
journalism as reporter, editor of the Brooklyn News, and police editor for the Tribune. 
Meanwhile he had revisited Denmark and been happily married to the girl whom he 
had loved from boyhood. The latter half of the book describes his labors to improve 
the conditions of the New York slums, the success of his book 'How the Other Half 
Lives  in rousing the public to the horribly overcrowded and unsanitary condition of 
the tenements, and the destruction through his efforts of a squalid district called 
11 Mulberry Bend, which was turned into a public playground. The account of the 
author's relations with Theodore Roosevelt, then Police Commissioner for New York, 
and a strong upholder of his efforts, is extremely interesting. A charming account of a 
visit to the old Danish home and of the happy domestic life of the family closes the 
narrative. There are many illustrations of Danish and American persons and places 
connected with the author, and the whole book has an intimate and homely personal 
touch.</summary>
  <summary author="Marsh, George P. (George Perkins) (1801-1882)" title="Man and Nature; Or, Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action" print_title="Man and Nature;\nOr,\nPhysical Geography\nas Modified\nby Human Action">MAN AND NATURE; or, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AS MODIFIED BY HUMAN ACTION. 
By George Perkins Marsh (1864). A work of great research and admirable exposition of interesting facts; showing how human action, such as the clearing away of 
forests, the drainage of land, the creation of systems of irrigation, etc., very greatly 
modifies the conditions belonging to the surface of the earth. Not only are the 
matters treated of great practical importance, but the pictures of conditions and 
changes in different lands, and over the many varieties of the earth's surface, are 
very entertaining. The work became at once a standard with international recognition; a considerably enlarged Italian edition was issued at Florence in 1870; and a 
second American edition, with further changes, appeared in 1874. In this final form 
the title was altered to 'The Earth as Modified by Human Action.' The earlier 
title was peculiarly appropriate; as it is not the earth only which the modifications 
by the hand of man reach, but the course of nature, climate for example, in connection with the earth, or vegetation wholly created by human action. In every way the 
book is a most suggestive one.</summary>

Jack Tanner is Shaw's whimsical and paradoxical conception of the modern Don 
Juan, no longer the huntsman in the duel of sex but the helpless quarry. An attractive young English girl, Ann Whitefield, decides to marry Tanner. Her first step 
toward her "marked down victim" is to have him appointed her guardian by her 
father's will. Tanner objects violently to this responsibility, but predicts that Ann 
will do exactly as she likes, and she does like that "dear father's will" be carried out. 
He is panic-stricken when 'Enery, his chauffeur, opens his eyes to Ann's real intentions. Tanner considers his only hope of escape from marriage, the loss of his freedom, and individuality, is flight. He dashes off to Europe in his motor car, seeking a 
"Mohammedan country where men are protected from women." Ann, with a party 
of friends, pursues him in another car. The destined husband-to-be struggles in vain 
when Ann overtakes him in the mountains of Spain. He denounces her as a vampire, 
and declares he will not marry. Ann triumphs, because she is Everywoman, the Life 
Force incarnate, the instrument of Nature who brooks no defeat. The unwilling 
Tanner surrenders to the Life Force. The play gives the author opportunity for the 
expression of amusingly brilliant talk against existing social institutions. An interlude reprinted in part in the LIBRARY is Tanner's dream, in which he plays the part 
of Don Juan Tenorio, while the other characters appear in other r61es of the Don 
Juan legend.</summary>
  <summary author="Connor, Ralph (1860-1937)" title="The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa" print_title="The Man from Glengarry:\nA Tale of the Ottawa">MAN FROM GLENGARRY, THE, by Ralph Connor (1901). This is a tale 
of the life among the Canadian lumbermen, of their toil in the great forest and 
their work of floating the timber down the rivers. The book opens with a vivid 
description of a fight between "Murphy's gang" and that of Macdonald, at a tavern 
where the rival lumbermen are assembled. In this fight, "Black Hugh" Macdonald 
is fatally injured and one of the motives of the story is the subduing of his intense 
desire to be revenged upon his enemy Le Noir. His son Ranald Macdonald, "The 
Man from Glengarry," takes up the feud and the author depicts the mental conflict 
which he undergoes before he rises to the height of saving the life of his mortal foe. 
The character of Mrs. Murray, the wife of the Scotch Presbyterian minister, is 
interestingly presented in the description of her religious influence over Ranald 
Macdonald and the other rough lumbermen, "a hundred of whom are ready to die 
for her." The story traces the development of Ranald's character from his introduction as a lad of seventeen years, at the tavern brawl, through many thrilling adventures in the woods and on the river, up to the time that he becomes the educated and 
successful manager of the British American Coal and Lumber Company. The 
religious element in the book is a strong one and predominates over that of the love 
theme. Ranald's wild nature is strongly influenced by his love for the beautiful but 
ambitious Maimie St. Clair, whose life he saves, and who accepts his boyish devotion, 
but who later turns from him in order to make a brilliant match. Ranald in the end 
finds his true affinity in the loyal and sprightly Kate Raymond, Maimie St. Clair's 
intimate friend. The story has much force and graphic quality and the picture of the 
sturdy Glengarry men, led by the moral and physical giant Macdonald Bhain, is 
truthful and convincing, as are the descriptions of life in the backwoods and on the 
river.</summary>
  <summary author="Mackenzie, Henry (1745-1831)" title="The Man of Feeling" print_title="The Man of Feeling">MAN OF FEELING, THE, by Henry Mackenzie. This short novel, published anonymously in 1771, is said to have created as much interest in England, when first 
published, as did 'La Nouvelle Heloise' in France. It is remarkable for its perspicuity of style; though it shows the influence which Sterne exercised over the author. 
Endeavoring to profit by the fact that the author was unknown, a clergyman of Bath, 
Mr. Eccles, claimed to be the author, presenting a manuscript with corrections, erasures, etc. Although the publisher then announced the name of the real author, on 
Eccles's tomb is inscribed: "Beneath this stone, the Man of Feeling lies.' The 
story purports to be the remainder of a manuscript left after the curate had extracted 
several leaves at random for gun-wadding. Young Harley, who is in love with his 
neighbor's daughter, Miss Walton, sets out for London with the object of acquiring 
the lease of an adjoining property. His experiences on the trip make up several short 
stories. He is a great physiognomist, but is deceived by two plausible gamblers. He 
visits Bedlam Hospital; and the pitiable sights there seen are described. A very 
interesting chapter is that describing a dinner with a Misanthrope, in which the
clergyman's complaints of his time seem to be the sempiternal ones of all nations. The 
story of his meeting with Miss Atkins, her rescue from a brothel and return to her 
father, is skillfully told. The cruelties of the press-gang, and of the treatment of 
East-Indian subjects, afford an opportunity for the "Man of Feeling" to condemn 
the East-Indian policy of the government. Upon his return, believing that Miss 
Walton is to marry another, he falls ill. She visits him; but her acknowledgment 
that she returns his affection does not come soon enough to save his life. </summary>

has two sons, Thomas and Peter. The elder, Thomas, marries below him and is 
disinherited. He dies, leaving a son, Philip, who is reared in the Deemster's house.

Kate, however, that the woman at last leaves him, and Philip offers what restitution 
he can. He makes a public declaration of his sin, resigns his high office, and takes in 
his own the hand of the woman he has loved and wronged, that they may begin life

the heroine from her girlhood, when she has vague dreams of social amelioration, is 
ignorant of facts and unjustly impatient with the existing order, especially with the 
upper classes. The story opens with scenes amidst the country gentry and their 
dependents. Marcella becomes engaged to Aldous Raeburn, the son of a nobleman, 
but breaks the engagement, partly through the influence of Wharton, a brilliant 
socialistic demagogue. She goes to the city, and by her intercourse with the poor, 
through her work as a trained nurse, she learns the difficulties in the way of enforced 
social reform, and gradually comes to a clearer appreciation of her early mistakes and 
the noble character of Aldous; with the result that *he finally returns to him. The 
novel contains graphic sketches of the state of the lower classes in England, rural and 
urban, one of the dramatic incidents of the plot being the trial and execution of the 
poacher Hurd. The scenes in Parliament, too, where Wharton's knavery is exposed, 
are powerfully realistic and effective. Marcella evolves into a noble type of the higher 
womanhood, and the story is one of the strongest and most successful Mrs. Ward 
has written.</summary>

to the memory of his fond mother, who, according to an old Scotch custom, was 
called by her maiden name, Margaret Ogilvy. "God sent her into the world," he 
says, "to open the minds of all who looked to beautiful thoughts." Margaret was 
a great reader; she would read at odd moments, and complete, the 'Decline and Fall' 
in a single winter. It was her delight to learn scraps of Horace from her son, and 
then bring them into her conversation with "colleged men. " 

Barrie, after leaving the university, enters journalism, and his proud mother 
cherishes every scrap he has written. She laughs when she sees the title of 'An Auld 
Licht Community' in a London paper, and is eager to know if her son receives pay 
for such an article, being greatly amazed to learn that this is the best remunerated 
of all his writing. "It's dreary, weary, up-hill work, but I've wrastled through with 
tougher jobs in my time, and please God, I'll wrastle through with this one," said a 
devout lady to whom some one had presented one of Barrie's books. He feared that 
his mother wrestled with his writings in the same spirit. 

Margaret was a great admirer of Carlyle, but her verdict of him was " I would 
rather have been his mother than his wife." She always spoke of "that Stevenson" 
with a sneer, but could not resist reading 'Treasure Island' and his other books. 
Barrie asks, "What is there about the man that so infatuates the public?" His 
mother's loyal reply is, "He takes no hold of me; I would hantle rather read your 
books. " Margaret is greatly pleased and very proud to find herself so often depicted 
in her son's books. She affects not to recognize it, but would give herself away unconsciously. She says, chuckling, "He tries to keep me out, but he canna; it's more 
than he can do." 

At the ripe age of seventy-five, Margaret Ogilvy peacefully passed away. Her 
last words were "God" and "love"; and her son adds, "I think God was smiling 
when he took her to him, as he had so often smiled at her during these seventy-six 
years." </summary>

posthumously in 1897. The hero is Barty Josselin, the story of whose life is told by 
his friend and companion, Robert Maurice. The school life of the two lads in the 
"Institution F. Brossard, " in Paris, is sketched in detail in Du Maurier's inimitable 
manner, the account being largely autobiographic. Barty is from the start a handsome, high-spirited, mischievous, and gifted fellow, thoroughly practical, yet with 
traits that have in them a strange idealism. After school, the boys return to England, 
and Barty goes into the army, but does not like it, and resigns. Then his eyes give 
out; and he travels for a time, and consults various physicians, being helped finally 
by a celebrated German specialist, Dr. Hasenclover, who assures him that he will be 
blind in only one eye. Before this, he has come to such melancholic discouragement 
that he intends suicide; being saved therefrom by discovering in a dream that he has a 
kind of guardian spirit, the Martian, a woman soul, who has undergone a series of 
incarnations, and is now an inhabitant of Mars. She advises him about his eyes, 
and thereafter, for many years, she constantly communicates with him and helps 
him, using a kind of shorthand called blaze. She inspires him to write wonderful 
books, whereby he becomes a famous author. Against her advice, he obeys the 
dictates of his heart by marrying Leah Gibson, a noble Jewess, when the Martian 
would have had him choose Julia Royce, an English belle whom he meets in Germany. 
The marriage is so happy that the Martian acknowledges her mistake. When 
Barty's daughter Martia is born, the Martian becomes incarnated in her form; and 
upon the young girl's death, the strange being from another world returns to Mars, 
whereupon Barty himself also passes away. The charm of the story lies in the genial 
description of bohemian friendship and love, seen retrospectively in the half-light of 
illusion; and in the suggestive way in which the odd supernatural element is woven 
into the narrative.</summary>
  <summary author="Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn (1810-1865)" title="Mary Barton" print_title="Mary Barton">MARY BARTON, by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (1848), is a forcible tale of 
Manchester, at the time when the manufacturing districts suffered the terrible 
distress that reached its height in 1842. It deals with the saddest and most 
terrible side of factory life, and was one of the first English novels to attempt 
this subject. 

John Barton, the father of Mary, is a weaver, an honest man, possessing more 
than the usual amount of intelligence of his class. When the story opens, he has 
plenty of work and high wages, which he spends to the last penny with no thought of 
the possible "rainy day." Suddenly his master fails, and he feels the effect of his 
improvidence. His wife and little son die from the want of ordinary necessaries, 
and Mary alone is left to him. 

Mary's beauty has attracted the attention of young Mr. Carson, the son of a 
wealthy mill-owner. Meanwhile she is deeply loved by Jem Nilson, a man of her 
own class. In the distress of this time it is decided to send a petition to Parliament. 
John Barton is chosen one of the delegates to present it. The failure of the petition 
embitters him so that he becomes a Chartist. He further increases his morbid feelings 
by the use of opium to deaden the pangs of hunger. Young Air. Carson has indulged 
in satires against the delegates, which unfortunately reach their ears and rouse their 
anger. They resolve on his assassination and determine the instrument by lot, which 
falls to John Barton. Suspicious circumstances lead to the apprehension of Jem 
Nilson. Mary suspects the truth, and determines to rescue her lover without 
exposing her father. At the trial Jem learns for the first time of Mary's love for him. 
John Barton disappears without rousing suspicion, and Jem is cleared through his 
ability to prove an alibi. The story ends with Barton's return to his home, and his 
death after a confession of his guilt. The chief interest of 'Mary Barton' lies in the 
touching simplicity of the descriptions of daily life among the artisan class. Their 
graphic power brings the reader into a vital sympathy with the life and scenes 
described. Some of the sad pictures of those toiling, suffering people are presented 
with intense pathos.</summary>

proper by Jean Henri Casimir Fabre, translated from the author's great work 'Souvenirs entomologiques' (1879-1905) by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (1914). With 
another volume, 'Bramble-Bees and Others' (1915) by the same translator, this 
book constitutes a complete treatise on wild bees. The mason bees were first observed by the author when he was teaching surveying to a class of boys on the open 
plains or "harmas" near Carpentras. Noticing that the boys would pause in their 
work to lick straws he discovered that they were eating honey from the clay nest of a 
large black bee. With these bees, the chalicodomae, he performed a number of experiments, attempting to determine, by means of marking them with chalk, the limits and 
nature of their power to find their way to their hives. He found that a large percentage made their way back through any obstacles and in spite of being swung 
about in boxes and confused; but he could not explain their instinct of direction. 
Fabre is conservative as to the reasoning power of bees, as distinguished from instinct, 
and is extremely sceptical with regard to the Darwinian hypothesis of protective 
mimesis. The book consists largely of records of experiments, which must be 
carefully followed but well repay the effort by the fascinating pictures and truths 
which they reveal. Fabre's graphic style and absolute sincerity render his scientific 
observations more attractive than the picturesque fancies of humanizing naturalists. 
He unveils the romance and mystery of the actual insect world.</summary>

of two men of totally different characteristics and identical physical endowments, 
who bargain to exchange places. The exchange allows one the liberty to indulge his 
craving for opium, the other an opportunity to satisfy his ambition for statesmanship 
and a public career. John Chilcote, M.P., rich, aristocratic, and prominent in the 
social and political world, encounters by chance in a London fog his double, John 
Loder, poor, obscure, and without friends. The fragmentary conversation which takes 
place at their meeting reveals to Chilcote the other's ambition, and to Loder the 
secret of his companion's weakness for morphia. Then follow a series of exchanges. 
The likeness deceives every one, even Chilcote's lovely wife who has long shunned 
and despised her uncongenial mate but now sees an encouraging change of mood which 
indicates a struggle to regain lost ambition and interest. Loder throws himself heart 
and soul into the political world and rekindles the public faith in his double, as well 
as the faith of his wife who clings with more and more hopefulness to the bright 
image which is at intervals blurred by the return of Chilcote. The two men find it 
more and more difficult to return to their original spheres: Chilcote because of his 
craving for morphia; Loder because of his marvelous gift for oratory as well as his 
increasing love for Eve, his double's wife. The crisis comes after Loder has won fame 
by his brilliant Parliamentary speech and has called forth from the delighted wife a 
passionate response to his own love. Loder feels his position unbearable and determines to relinquish it for ever. Chilcote's excesses make his continuance of the 
deception necessary, however, and he determines to explain everything to Eve; she 
has meanwhile discovered his secret, but nevertheless begs him not to leave her. 
Loder convinces her that their duty lies in the way of renunciation and together they 
go in search of Chilcote. Upon reaching his lodging they find him dead. After the 
relaxing of the strain under which both have been laboring they hesitate as to their 
future decision. Loder suggests going away to win a new position for himself, but 
Eve points out to him that his duty lies in the direction of the discharge of those 
obligations and responsibilities which he has assumed so extensively and he acknowledges that he has now to consider the needs of his country which has honored him 
with its confidence, and of the woman who loves him.</summary>

and in it the reader is led to an artist's London, and wanders through an artist's 
world. From early boyhood the ruling passion of Matthew Strang's life is a love of 
art and a desire to paint pictures. A poor boy, struggling against poverty and misfortune, he ever keeps this goal in view. Overwhelmed by want and suffering, he 
marries a young woman his intellectual inferior, but possessed of a small competency 
by which he is enabled to pursue his beloved vocation. He becomes a great artist; 
and the distance widens between him and his commonplace wife, who has no appreciation of his work or ideals. Matthew Strang is courted by distinguished people, 
and breathes an atmosphere that intensifies the contrast with his own home, which he 
rarely visits. He is thrown into the society of Eleanor Wyndwood, a beautiful and 
accomplished woman. She is his ideal, and he falls in love with her. He feels that 
inspired by her companionship he could achieve the highest success. Eleanor returns 
his love; and Strang is on the point of forgetting all but his passion for her, when he is 
suddenly awakened to the realization that his highest duty lies in the renunciation of 
his desires. He goes back to his nagging, prosaic wife, and irritating household, 
having bid farewell to his love and art. But the latter is not to be taken leave of; 
for. away from the whirl of society and in the solitude of his out-of-town studio, he
toils to accomplish his best work. Here "the master " at last produces his greatest 
pictures; here he becomes not only master of his art, but "master of his own soul." 
Throughout the book the point of view is profoundly poetic, and the character of 
"the master" is developed with truly masterly skill: as are also the portraits of Billy, 
the artist's deformed brother; the sharp-tongued Rosina, his wife and his foster-sister, 
steadfast Ruth Hailey, whose gentle influence and self-effacing love are contrasted 
with the more selfish affection of the impressionable and impulsive Eleanor. The 
book is filled with clever epigrammatic phrases, and abounds in humor.</summary>
  <summary author="Corelli, Marie (1855-1924)" title="The Master-Christian" print_title="The Master Christian">MASTER CHRISTIAN, THE, by Marie Corelli (1900). This book is an 
arraignment of the ecclesiastical system and of modern Christianity as typified 
partly by the Church of Rome and partly by the Church of England. The keynote is struck in the opening chapter, when the author describes the sensuous 
atmosphere of a great cathedral as the background for the ascetic figure of Cardinal 
Boupre, who typifies the simple-minded and saintly son of the church, and is contrasted with the Abbe* Vergniaud and other ecclesiastics in the tale, who were both 
worldly and wicked. The book is for the most part a series of conversations carried 
on sometimes among the "servants of Christ," sometimes in fashionable society, 
while the motive running throughout all is the constant struggle of the spiritual 
against the material. The Cardinal has been present at a service in a Paris church 
during which the immoral Abbe" is nearly murdered by his own natural son, and the 
Abba's confession of his sin and acknowledgment of his child give great offense at 
Rome, whither the Cardinal is summoned. Here the principal characters of the 
story are assembled, among them Aubrey Leigh, an American actor and journalist, 
who is deeply pained by the pride and wickedness of the modern churches, and the 
Cardinal's beautiful niece Anglea, who has painted a wonderful picture which ultimately brings her under the ban of the church. A brief outline can give only a 
faint idea of the many subjects touched upon by Miss Corelli in this book; its six 
hundred pages contain her opinions on many of the topics of the day.</summary>

Scotch romance of the eighteenth century, beginning with the Stuart uprising of 
1745. It is a sombre tragedy of the enmity of two brothers, of whom the elder, 
James Durrie the Master, takes the side of King Charlie; the younger, Henry, 
that of King George. Alison Graeme, a kinswoman with a fortune, is intended for 
the wife of the Master; but on his going to join the Stuart and being believed dead 
she is married to Henry, without loving him. The tale is narrated mostly by the 
steward of Ballantrae, John MacKellar, who is devoted to the house and to Henry 
Durrie, whose nobility, set beside the wickedness of his brother, he realizes to the 
full. After the marriage appears Chevalier Burke, a companion of the Master, to 
say that he is not dead; Burke narrates their wanderings, which include an episode 
on a pirate ship and adventures among Indians in the wilds of New York. MacKellar then takes up the tale, describing the persecutions suffered by Mr. Henry, 
whose brother first writes to demand a large sum of money; then returns, impoverished and disgraced, to his paternal home, where he foments trouble between Henry 
and his wife. Finally, goaded by the Master's insults, Henry fights a duel with 
him and leaves him for dead; but he is carried off to sea by smugglers and recovers, 
remaining away for some time, and traveling in India, as is communicated by Burke. 
Then the Master reappears with Secundra Dass, an East-Indian, whom he has
made his creature; whereupon Henry and his wife and children betake themselves 
secretly to New York, where Mrs. Durrie owns an estate, leaving the Master at 
Ballantrae in the charge of MacKellar. James soon finds out his brother's where-abouts and pursues him, keeping to his tactics of persecution. Arrived there, he 
does all he can to harm Henry, who is installed in a position befitting his rank. 
False news from Scotland to the effect that the Master, though a rebel, is to have 
his title restored, which will cut off Henry's son from the succession, leads the younger 
brother to concoct a plan whereby James, who intends going to the northern wilderness to regain pirate treasure he has buried there, shall be led to his death. The 
Master for a time outwits the party of adventurers who attend him, with the purpose of first getting the treasure, then making away with their nominal leader. 
Finally, to escape them, he feigns death and is buried by Secundra Dass, who puts 
him in a state of suspended animation. When Henry and his party seek the grave,

(1842). This book was written with a double motive: to amuse the author's children, and to correct various errors which he found in a work of a similar nature 
'The Swiss Family Robinson.' 

Mr. Seagrave and his family, returning to their Australian home after a visit to 
England, are shipwrecked on an uninhabited island with their black servant Juno, 
and Masterman Ready, an old sailor. As they see no signs of immediate relief, they 
build a house, and make themselves comfortable. They cultivate and explore the 
island, finding many animals of which they make use, and build a strong stockade 
around the house in order to be fortified in case of attack. It is not long before they 
are glad to avail themselves of its protection against a band of cannibals from a neighboring island. They beat off the savages again and again, but are kept in a close 
state of siege until their water gives out. Ready, attempting to procure some from 
an unprotected part of the inclosure, is severely wounded by a savage who has 
managed to steal upon him unawares. Another and more determined attack is 
made, which seems certain of success, when the booming of cannon is heard and 
round shot come plowing through the ranks of the terrified savages, who now think 
of nothing but safety. The shots come from a schooner commanded by Captain 
Osborn, the former master of the Pacific, who has come to rescue the Seagraves. 
Ready dies of his wounds and is buried on the island, and the survivors are carried 
in safety to Australia. The story is told in an interesting and entertaining manner, 
and is enlivened throughout by the many amusing experiences of Tommy Seagrave, 
the scapegrace of the family. The descriptions of the ingenious contrivances of the 
castaways are accurately given and form an interesting feature of the book.</summary>
  <summary author="Palacio Valdés, Armando (1853-1938)" title="Maximina" print_title="Maximina">MAXIMINA, by Armando Palacio Valdés (1887). A vivid picture of modern 
Spain is shown in this interesting novel, the scene of which is laid chiefly in Madrid. 
Miguel de Rivera marries Maximina, a modest country girl. He brings her to Madrid and lives happily until he finds his fortune compromised. As editor of a Liberal 
newspaper, he signs notes to enable the paper to continue; with the promise of 
Mendoza, a politician and one of the backers, that they shall be taken up when 
due. When the Liberals come into power, the holder of the notes calls for payment. The responsible parties neglect to protect Miguel; and Mendoza suggests 
that he sign more notes to gain time, and be a candidate for Congress, so that by 
their united efforts they can force the minister to settle. Against his will he enters 
the contest, with a promise of government support; but is sacrificed for political 
reasons, and his entire fortune is swept away. A son is born to him at this time, 
and he finds himself without employment or funds. Maximina dies, and Miguel 
becomes secretary to Mendoza, who has become minister. The story of the unsuccessful attacks on Maximina by Don Alphonso, a fashionable roue, and his success 
with Miguel's sister, is interwoven with the main plot. The author introduces us 
to life behind the scenes at the newspaper office, and the halls of Congress, and shows 
the petty political intrigues of the rural districts of Spain, which are readily recognized for their fidelity by any one acquainted with the life depicted. </summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Measure for Measure" print_title="Measure for Measure">MEASURE FOR MEASURE, written about 1604, is one of Shakespeare's later 
comedies, the outline of the plot taken from the Italian novelist Cinthio and from 
Whetstone's tragedy of 'Promos and Cassandra.' License has now for a long
while in Vienna run by the hideous law, as mice by lions; and the sagacious but 
eccentric duke attempts to enforce it, especially against sins of lust. The scenes 
that follow are gloomy and painful, and search deep into the conscience; yet all 
ends happily after all. The motif is mercy; a meting unto others, measure for 
measure, as we would wish them to mete unto us. The duke feigns a desire to travel, 
and appoints as deputies Angelo and Escalus. They begin at once to deal with 
sexual immorality: Escalus none too severely with a loathsome set of disreputable 
folk; but Angelo most mercilessly with young Claudio, who, in order to secure 
dower for his betrothed, had put off legal avowal of their irregular relation until 
her condition had brought the truth to light. Angelo condemns Claudio to death. 
His sister Isabella, about to enter a nunnery of the votarists of Saint Clare, is induced to plead for his life. As pure as snow, yet, as her "cheek-roses" show, not 
cold-blooded, her beauty ensnares the outward-sainted deputy and "seemer," 
who proposes the release of her brother to her as the price of her chastity. Isabella 
has plenty of hot blood and moral indignation. She refuses with noble scorn; and 
when her brother begs his life at her hands, bids him die rather than see her dishonored. The duke, disguised as a friar, has overheard in the prison her splendid 
defense of virtue, and proposes a plan for saving her virtue and her brother's life 
too. It is this: There dwells alone, in a certain moated grange, forgotten and forlorn now these five years, Mariana, legally affianced to Lord Angelo, and who loves 
him still, although owing to the loss of her dowry he has cast her off. The friar-duke proposes that Isabella shall feign compliance, make an appointment, and then 
send Mariana in her place. Isabella agrees to risk her reputation, and the dejected 
grass-widow is easily won over to meet Angelo by night in his brick-walled garden, 
The base deputy, fearing Claudio's revenge if he frees him, breaks his promise and 
sends word to have him executed. The duke and the provost of the prison send 
Angelo the head of a prisoner (much like Claudio) who has died overnight; Isabella 
supposes her brother to be dead. The duke, entering the city gates in state, in 
propria persona, hears her petition for justice. Angelo confesses; and after (by 
the duke's order) marrying Marianna, is pardoned. Indeed, there is a general 
amnesty; and the duke takes to wife Isabella, who thus enters upon a wider sphere 
of usefulness than that of a cloister. </summary>
  <summary author="Euripides" title="Medea" print_title="Medea">MEDEA, a tragedy by Euripides, acted 431 B.C. The play opens on the day 
when Jason, having put aside Medea, daughter of Gaetes, King of Colchis, is to wed 
the daughter of Creon, King of Corinth. Medea, by her magic art had enabled 
Jason to win from her father the Golden Fleece, had joined him in his flight to 
Greece, had killed her brother, Absyrtus, who pursued them, had restored Jason to 
his kingdom of lolcos by inducing the daughters of the usurper, Peleus, to murder 
their father, and had then accompanied Jason to Corinth, where she had borne him 
two children. Overcome with indignation at the faithlessness of her husband, she 
has now uttered threats against his proposed new bride. These have been reported 
to Creon, who at the beginning of the play punishes Medea by banishing her and 
her children. An introductory dialogue between Medea's nurse and the children's 
pedagogue puts these facts before the audience, and is followed by the entrance of 
the chorus of Corinthian ladies whose ode is frequently interrupted by the laments 
of Medea, hidden behind the scenes. There ensues a dialogue between Medea and 
Creon in which he agrees at her request to defer the exile for a day; a scene with 
Jason, who excuses his course on the ground of desire for royal authority to benefit 
his sons and Medea, attributes her exile to her own unrestrained tongue, and offers 
her money; a conversation with Aegeus, King of Athens, whom Medea induces to 
swear to give her an asylum; an explanation to the chorus of her plan of vengeance; 
and an episode with Jason in which she pretends to justify his conduct, urges him 
to plead with his new bride that the children may not be exiled, and sends her two 
sons to enforce this plea with a present of a crown and robes, both poisoned. The 
children soon announce the success of their mission. Medea bids them a tender 
fareweE and sends them into the house, resolved to put them to death. A messenger now comes in reporting the death of the bride and also of Creon, through the 
poisoned ornaments. Medea now enters the house, whence are heard the death 
cries of her children as she murders them. Jason, coming in to rescue his children 
from the vengeance of the Corinthians, is horrified to learn that they have fallen 
by the hand of their own mother. He attempts to break into the palace; but Medea 
appears on the roof in a chariot drawn by dragons, and after bitterly denouncing 
her faithless husband departs for the asylum promised her in Athens. The chorus 
in this play is sympathetic with Medea, but shocked at her crime, which, however, 
it makes no movement to prevent. Like all the plays of Euripides, 'Medea' is 
full of rebellious questionings of the ways of God to Man. It excels in pathos and 
in psychological insight.</summary>
  <summary author="Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome (121-180)" title="Meditations" print_title="Meditations">MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS, a collection of ethical and philosophical 
reflections, written in Greek by the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (121-180 
A.D.), at leisure moments during his campaigns against the tribes east of the Danube (c 170 A.D.). The book consists of detached paragraphs, some very short, 
others running to one or two hundred words in length, evidently set down at times 
of contemplation as a guidance to self-examination and an incentive to self-improvement. Marcus Aurelius is the most distinguished exponent of the Stoic philosophy. 
His book illustrates its practical working in a mind and character unusually pure, 
lofty, and humane and in a sphere of life offering the greatest opportunities for beneficent action. The leading ideas are that the universe is governed by Supreme 
Reason; that all things therefore are for the best; that we should not complain or 
be perturbed at suffering, or injuries which are not in our control, since these are 
evidently permitted by an all- wise Providence; that towards everything not in our 
power we should adopt an attitude of complete indifference; and that our one concern should be the attainment of virtue through the exercise of our free will. Virtue 
consists in the control of the lower appetites and passions, the maintenance of 
equanimity in all circumstances, however distressing, the performance of justice 
and charity to our fellowmen, and the reverencing of the Supreme Reason and its 
manifestations. The austerity of this creed is lightened up by the delicacy of the 
emperor's moral insight, his human sympathy, and the simple unassuming dignity 
of his character.</summary>

young Jewish musician, who has escaped to New York from the massacre of Kishenev and sees in America the great crucible, the melting pot, in which people of every 
race and creed are fused into one nation. He earns his living playing the violin in 
cheap music halls, and devotes all his spare time to the composition of a symphony 
'America' which shall express his ardent patriotism. At the settlement he meets 
and loves Vera Revendal, also a Russian, but a Gentile and the daughter of a nobleman. She tries to interest Quincy Davenport, a spendthrift millionaire, in David's 
symphony, but David rejects this help and denounces him and his class as untrue 
to American ideals. His love for Vera causes his orthodox uncle to turn him out 
of his home. Davenport, who wants to divorce his wife and marry Vera, brings 
her father to America to prevent her marriage to a Jew. David recognizes in Baron 
Revendal the inhuman officer who directed the slaughter of his father, mother, and
sister at Kishenev, and in a frenzy of remembrance renounces Vera. As his symphony is being played to the immigrants at the settlement on a Fourth of July, 
he realizes that he has been false to the ideals of his music; he returns to his conception of the United States as the crucible that could melt all race differences and 
feuds, and the lovers are reunited.</summary>
  <summary author="Xenophon (-431--355)" title="The Memorabilia" print_title="The Memorabilia">MEMORABILIA, THE. The 'Apomnemoneumata,' by Xenophon (c 434-0 355 
B.C.), is generally known by its Latin title of 'The Memorabilia,' an incorrect and 
somewhat misleading translation of the Greek word. This is the most important 
of the writings that the author has devoted to the memory of Socrates. Like Plato, 
he dwells principally on those doctrines of the master that harmonize with his own 
views. In the beginning, by way of preface, he replies to the positive accusations 
brought against the philosopher, Then he proceeds to develop his real purpose; 
which is to depict the true Socrates, not from the opinions of others, which are always controvertible, but from his own words and actions, and in this way place 
under the eyes of the Athenians a correct likeness of the man they condemned 
because they did not know him. He next treats of the many examples of right 
living given by Socrates to his countrymen, and of the lesson of his life. After the 
lesson of his life comes the lesson of his discourses. This is embodied in a series 
of dialogues between Socrates and persons engaged in different occupations, upon 
the subjects which engrossed his whole attention: piety towards the gods, temperance, the duties incumbent on children with regard to parents, friendship, the political virtues, the useful arts, and the science of dialectics. As it was Xenophon's 
object to create a feeling of love and veneration for his master among the Athenians, 
he touches chiefly on those points in the character of Socrates that he believed 
would conduce to this end. Thus he describes him as teaching that in matters 
of religion every one should follow the usages of his city. Socrates, he says, sacrificed openly and publicly; he not only consulted the oracles, but he strongly advised his friends to consult them; he believed in divination, and paid close attention 
to the signs by which the divinity communicated with himself. More than half 
of the chapters in the third book are devoted to the conversation of Socrates with 
generals and hipparchs, and Xenophon attributes much of his own knowledge of 
military matters to his good fortune in having been acquainted with his master. 
The most beautiful dialogues, however, are those which deal with the feelings that 
ought to actuate the members of the same family, the love of the mother for her 
child, and of brother for brother. The chapters which conclude the work are noted 
for deep feeling, tenderness, and elevation of thought.</summary>

Henry Fairfield Osborn (1915). The book is a history of the origin and development of man from the anthropoid apes to the Old Stone Age and the beginnings 
of the modern European races. The latest anthropological discoveries, including the various skeletons of primitive man found at Heidelberg and Neanderthal, and the later specimens of the more civilized Cr6-magnon race, occurring in 
the valleys of Southern France and Northern Spain, are combined with the latest 
archaeological and geological data relevant to the subject in a clear and orderly 
narrative of human development. The book is superbly illustrated with reconstructions of early types of men and animals and reproductions of drawings of men,
horses, fish, and other creatures, made on the walls of caverns in the regions mentioned by "upper palaeolithic artists/' These representations show considerable 
skill and appreciation of nature on the part of a race which existed at least 25,000 
years ago. Abundant maps and diagrams accompany the text, which expounds 
the subject clearly, avoiding undue discussion of controverted points, and aiming 
at a straightforward presentation of admitted facts. As the writer lays no claim 
to authority as an anthropologist, and relies in part on the investigations of Cartilhac, Breuil, Obermaies, and others, the book is rather a compilation for the 
layman and a general conspectus for the scientist than a piece of original investigation; but it is an exceedingly valuable summary, skilfully arranged by an archaeologist of distinction, of the latest conclusions as to the history of primitive mankind.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="The Merry Wives of Windsor" print_title="The Merry Wives\nof Windsor">MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, by Shakespeare (printed 1602), is a play written, according to tradition, at the request of Queen Elizabeth, who wanted to see 
Falstaff in love. With its air of village domesticity and out-o'-doorness is united 
the quintessential spirit of fun and waggery. Its gay humor never fails, and its 
readers alway wish it five times as long as it is. The figures on this rich old tapestry 
resolve themselves, on inspection, into groups: The jolly ranter and bottle-rinser, 
mine host of the Garter Inn, with Sir John Falstaff and his men, Bardolph, Nym, 
and Pistol; the merry wives, Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page, and their families; then 
Shallow (the country justice), with his cousin of the "wee little face and little 
yellow beard" (Slender), and the latter's man Simple; further Dr. Caius, the French 
physician, who speaks broken English, as does Parson Hugh Evans, the Welshman; 
lastly Dame Quickly (the doctor's housekeeper), and Master Fenton, in love with 
sweet Anne Page. Shallow has a grievance against Sir John for killing his deer; 
and Slender has matter in his head against him, for Sir John broke it. But Falstaff 
and his men outface the two cheese-parings, and they forget their "pribbles and 
prabbles" in the parson's scheme of marrying Slender to Anne Page. But the irascible doctor has looked that way too, and sends a "challenge" to Evans. Mine 
host fools them both by sending each to a separate place for the duel. They make 
friends, and avenge themselves on the Boniface by getting his horses run off with. 
Falstaff sends identically worded love-letters to Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page, hoping 
to replenish his purse from their husbands' gold. But Pistol and Nym, in revenge 
for dismissal, peach to said husbands. The jealous Ford visits Falstaff under the 
name of Brook, and offers him a bag of gold if he will seduce Mrs. Ford for him. 
Jack assures him that he has an appointment with her that very day. And so he 
has. But the two wives punish him badly, and he gets nothing from them but a 
cast out of a buck-basket into a dirty ditch, and a sound beating from Ford. The 
midnight scene in Windsor Park, where Falstaff, disguised as Herne the Hunter, 
with stag-horns on his head, is guyed by the wives and their husbands and pinched 
and burned by the fairies' tapers, is most amusing. During the fairies' song Fenton 
steals away Anne Page and marries her. The doctor, by previous arrangement, 
with mother Ford, leads away a fairy in green to a priest, only to discover that he 
has married a boy. And Slender barely escapes the same fate; for he leads off to 
Eton Church another "great lubberly boy," dressed in white as agreed with Mr. 
Page. Anne has given the slip to both father and mother, having promised her 
father to wear white for Slender and her mother to dress in green for the doctor. </summary>
  <summary author="Doyle, Arthur Conan (1859-1930)" title="Micah Clarke" print_title="Micah Clarke">MICAH CLARKE, by A. Conan Doyle (1888), presents in the form of a novel a 
graphic and vivid picture of the political condition in England during the Western 
rebellion, when James, Duke of Monmouth, aspired to the throne, and when Englishmen were in arms against Englishmen. The story tells of the adventures 
of the young man whose name the book bears, of the many perils which he encountered on his journey from Havant to Taunton to join the standard of Monmouth, 
and of the valiant part he played in the final struggle, when the King's troops were 
victorious and hundreds of Protestants, who had escaped death on the field, were 
hanged for treason. 

Through this melancholy but thrilling narrative runs a pretty vein of love-making. The gentle and innocent Puritan maid, Mistress Ruth Timewell, who had 
never heard of Cowley or Waller or Dryden, and who was accustomed to derive 
enjoyment from such books as the 'Alarm to the Unconverted,' 'Faithful Contendings,' or 'Bull's Spirit Cordial,' finds love more potent than theology, and prefers 
Reuben Lockarby, a tavern-keeper's son, to Master John Derrick, a man of her 
own faith. 

But the climax of 'Micah Clarke' is reached in the description of the battle on
the plain in the early morning, in which one learns what religion meant in England 
toward the close of the sixteenth century. Against the disciplined and well-equipped regiments of the King are opposed Monmouth's untrained and ragged 
forces peasants, armed only with scythes, pikes, and clubs, but with the unfaltering 
courage of fanaticism in their hearts and with psalms on their lips. 

'Micah Clarke' is a book for old and young; a book which instructs, while it 
quickens the imagination and stirs the blood.</summary>

has recently come to live in the district; and whom at first he dislikes on account 
of her apparent frivolity and insincerity. She persists in making excuses to see him 
and he gradually falls a prey to her fascinations and admits to her that he is enamored 
of her. In great mental agony he retires for meditation and prayer to St. Decuman's 
Island, an uninhabited island, where he had built a small cabin around the shrine 
of the saint. Mrs. Lesden had written to him that he is the only man living who 
can inspire her to attempt the life of a saint, but that the cost to him would be too 
great. He burns her letter and hopes that he has overcome the temptation, when 
a tap comes to the door and she appears. He persuades her to renounce their 
love, but finds that there is no means of return for her from the island that night. 
Afterwards Michael in the presence of Rose makes public renunciation of his fault 
in his own church. Going to Italy to spend his time in penance and retirement, he

  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="Middlemarch" print_title="Middlemarch">MIDDLEMARCH, by George Eliot (1872). This, the last but one of George Eliot's 
novels, she is said to have regarded as her greatest work. The novel takes its name 
from a provincial town in or near which its leading characters live. The book is 
really made up to two stories, one centring around the Vincy family, and the 
other around Dorothea Brooke and her relatives. On account of this division of 
interest, the construction of the story has been severely criticized as clumsy and 
inartistic. 

Dorothea Brooke, the most prominent figure on the very crowded canvas, is an 
orphan, who, with her sister Celia, lives with her uncle Mr. Brooke, a man of vacillating and uneven temperament. Dorothea's longing for a lofty mission leads her 
to marry an elderly and wealthy clergyman, Rev. Edward Casaubon, who has 
retired from the ministry to give his time to an important piece of literary work. 
Dorothea, though not yet twenty, hopes to be his amanuensis and helper; and is 
greatly grieved to find that her husband sets slight value on her services. In other 
ways she has been disillusioned before the death of Mr. Casaubon, a year and a half 
after their marriage. A rather insulting provision of his will directs that his widow 
shall lose her income if she marries Will Ladislaw, a young cousin of Mr. Casaubon 's. 
Ladislaw is partly of Polish descent; and both his mother and his grandmother had 
been disinherited by their English relatives for marrying foreigners. Ladislaw owes 
his education to Mr. Casaubon; but not until after the death of the latter does the 
friendship between the younger man and Dorothea take the tinge of love. 

Rosamond Vincy, who may be called a minor heroine, is the daughter of the 
mayor of Middlemarch. She is a beautiful girl, whose feeling that she is much more 
refined than her commonplace relatives, leads her to lofty matrimonial aspirations. 
She wins the love of Dr. Lydgate, who, though nephew to a baronet, has a hard 
struggle to establish himself as a Middlemarch physician, with Dr. Sprague and 
Dr. Minchin as rivals. Neither he nor his wife knows how to economize; and the 
latter, feeling her husband's poverty an insult to herself, is a hindrance to him in 
every way. The story of his efforts to maintain his family, and at the same time 
to be true to his ambition to add to the science of his profession, is a sad one. In 
the characters of Dorothea and Lydgate, George Eliot develops the main purpose of 
this novel, which is less distinctly ethical than some of the others. Her aim in 
' Middlemarch ' was to show how the thought and action of even very high-minded 
persons is apt to be modified and altered by their environment. Both Dorothea 
and Lydgate become entangled by their circumstances; though in his case the disaster is greater than in hers, and in each case it is a moral and not a social decline 
which is pointed out. Two secondary love stories in ' Middlemarch ' are those of 
the witty Mary Garth and the spendthrift Fred Vincy, and of Celia Brooke, and Sir 
James Chettam. The chorus, which constantly reflects Middlemarch sentiment 
at every turn of affairs, is a large one, including Mrs. Fitchett, Kirs. Dill, Mrs. Waule, 
Mrs. Renfrew, Mrs. Plymdale, Mrs. Bulstrode, Mrs. Vincy; and among the men, 
Mr. Dollop, Mr. Dill, Mr. Brothrop Trumbull, Mr. Horrock, Mr. Wrech, Mr. Thesiger, and Mr. Standish. 

More carefully drawn are the caustic Airs. Cadwallader, the self-denying Air. 
Farebrother, hypocritical Mr. Bulstrode, the miser Featherstone, and the honorable Caleb Garth and his self-reliant wife. </summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="A Midsummer Night's Dream" print_title="A Midsummer\nNight's Dream">MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, by Shakespeare, was written previous to 1598; 
the poet drawing for materials on Plutarch, Ovid, and Chaucer. The roguish sprite 
Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, is a sort of half-brother of Ariel, and obeys Oberon as 
Ariel obeys Prospero. The theme of this joyous comedy is love and marriage. 
Duke Theseus is about to wed the fair Hippolyta. Lysander is in love with Hermia, 
and so is Demetrius; though in the end, Demetrius, by the aid of Oberon, is led back 
to his first love Helena. The scene lies chiefly in the enchanted wood near the 
duke's palace in Athens. In this wood Lysander and Hermia, and Demetrius and 
Helena, wander all night and meet with strange adventures at the hands of Puck 
and the tiny fairies of Queen Titania's train. Like her namesake in 'All's Well,' 
Helena is here the wooer: "Apollo flies and Daphne leads the chase." Oberon pities 
her, and sprinkling the juice of the magic flower love-in-idleness in Demetrius's 
eyes, restores his love for her; but not before Puck, by a mistake in anointing the 
wrong man's eyes, has caused a train of woes and perplexities to attend the footsteps 
of the wandering lovers. Puck, for fun, claps an ass's head on to weaver Bottom's 
shoulders, who thereupon calls for oats and a bottle of hay. By the same flower 
juice, sprinkled in her eyes, Oberon leads Titania to dote on Bottom, whose hairy 
head she has garlanded with flowers, and stuck musk roses behind his ears. Everybody seems to dream: Titania, in her bower carpeted with violets and canopied with 
honeysuckle and sweet-briar, dreamed she was enamored of an ass, and Bottom 
dared not say aloud what he dreamed he was; while in the fresh morning the lovers 
felt the fumes of the sleepy enchantment still about them

But we must introduce the immortal players of 'Pyramus and Thisbe.' Bottom 
is a first cousin of Dogberry, his drollery the richer for being partly self-conscious. 
With good strings to their beards and new ribbons for their pumps, he and his men 
meet at the palace, "on the duke's wedding-day at night." Snout presents Wall; 
in one hand he holds some lime, some plaster and a stone, and with the open fingers 
of the other makes a cranny through which the lovers whisper. A fellow with lantern and thorn-bush stands for Moon. The actors kindly and in detail explain to 
the audience what each one personates; and the lion bids them not to be afeard, 
for he is only Snug the joiner, who roars extempore. The master of the revels 
laughs at the delicious humor till the tears run down his cheeks (and you don't 
wonder), and the lords and ladies keep up the fun by a running fire of witticisms 
when they can keep their faces straight. Theseus is an idealized English gentleman, 
large-molded, gracious, and wise. His greatness is shown in his genuine kindness 
to the poor players in their attempt to please him.</summary>
  <summary author="Mill, John Stuart (1806-1873)" title="Autobiography" print_title="Autobiography">AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHN STUART MILL (1873). The reader who for the 
first time learns how John Stuart Mill was brought up by his father, James Mill, 
will perhaps wonder how the scholar ever survived so arduous a regime, so early 
imposed. Starting Greek at the age of three, he had read many works in that 
language before he began Latin in his eighth year. Numerous histories occupied 
a large part of the interval until his twelfth year-, when he began logic, to which he 
added political economy a year later. Brought up by his father 'to think that 
nothing was known of the manner in which the world came into existence, he says 
of himself in this book that he had not thrown off religious belief, he had never had it, 
a circumstance which lends all the greater interest to views which he was elsewhere 
to express in 'The Utility of Religion and Theism. ' He records the formation of the 
Utilitarian Society (whence the term Utilitarian passed into general use, though 
Mill had borrowed it from Gait's 'Annals of the Parish'), by himself and a group of 
other young men who took Utility as their standard in ethics and politics. Later 
he helped to found the Westminster Review as a Radical offset to the Edinburgh 
and Quarterly, then in the heyday of their power. At that time he and his fellow-workers based their political faith on representative government and complete 
freedom of discussion. His intercourse for twenty years with the lady who was 
afterwards, on the death of her first husband, to become his wife, was a source of 
profound intellectual stimulus to him and modified his views on religion, ethics, 
political economy and every subject which occupied his mind. It is interesting 
to note that the man who wrote a classic treatise 'On Liberty' could also epitomise 
in these words his own and his most intimate fellow-workers' views. "While we 
repudiated with the greatest energy that tyranny of society over the individual 
which most Socialistic systems are supposed to involve, we yet looked forward to a 
time when society will no longer be divided into the idle and the industrious; when 
the rule that they who do not work shall not eat, will be applied not to paupers 
only, but impartially to all; when the division of the produce of labour, instead 
of depending, as in so great a degree it now does, on the accident of birth, will be 
made by concert on an acknowledged principle of justice; and when it will no 
longer either be, or be thought to be, impossible for human beings to exert themselves strenuously in procuring benefits which are not to be exclusively their 
own, but to be shared with the society they belong to." The most poignant 
section of a pathetically interesting self -revelation is Mill's lament for the 
loss of his wife. "Her memory is to me a religion, and her approbation the 
standard by which, summing up as it does all worthiness, I endeavour to regulate 
my life."</summary>
  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="The Mill on the Floss" print_title="The Mill on the Floss">MILL ON THE FLOSS, THE, by George Eliot (1860), one of the masterpieces of 
fiction, is like ' Middlemarch ' a tragedy, though a tragedy destitute of the usual 
heroic setting and grandiloquent circumstances. The author found her tragic 
material in the commonplace lives of English working-people; and traced the workings of fate in the obscure development of a young girl, with passions no less strong 
than those of a woman in some ancient Greek tragedy, suffering in a magnificent 
environment, under the gaze of the world, f. Maggie Tulliver, the daughter of the 
Miller of Dorlcote Mill, is from childhood 'misunderstood and dominated by the 
coarse-grained well-meaning people about her. Her brother Tom, a hearty young 
animal, with selfish masculine instincts, accepts her devotion as he would that of a 
dog. He teases her because she is a girl. He hates her when she eludes him by 
going into her fairyland of imagination, whither he cannot follow her. She loves 
him devotedly; but to her love always brings suffering. She is ill regulated, and is 
therefore not a favorite with her aunts, Mrs. Glegg and Mrs. Pullet, who can see 
no trace of the respectable Dodson blood in her. Maggie's childhood is a series of 
conflicts with respectability. In her girlhood the passionate little heart is somewhat 
subdued to her surroundings. Family troubles are brewing. They culminate in 
the death of Mr. Tulliver, and in the sale of Dorlcote Mill. Maggie ceases to be 
a child, becomes a woman. The needs of her nature find satisfaction in the companionship of Philip Wakem, the crippled son of the lawyer who helped to ruin Mr. 
Tulliver. It is the old story of Verona, of the lovers whose families are at feud, 
translated into homely English life. Maggie must renounce Philip. Tom hates 
him and his race with all the strength of his hard-and-fast uncompromising nature. 
Maggie, starving for beauty, for the joy of love and life, seeks to satisfy her spiritual 
cravings in that classic of renunciation, the 'Imitation of Christ.' She feeds her 
rich nature with the thoughts of the dead. The next temptation in her way is 
Stephen Guest, betrothed to her cousin Lucy. Stephen represents to Maggie, 
although she does not know it, the aesthetic element that is lacking in her barren 
life. The two are thrown together. Their mutual passion masters them. Maggie 
almost consents to go away with Stephen, finds herself indeed on the journey; but 
at the last minute turns back, though she knows that she has endangered her good 
name. The worst interpretation is put upon her conduct. From that time on 
she faces the contumely of the little village community. Death, and death only, 
can reconcile her to the world and to Tom, who has stood as the embodiment of the 
world's harshest judgment. They are drowned in the great flood of the Floss: 
"Brother and sister had gone down together in an embrace never to be parted; 
living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their 
little hands in love and roamed the daisied fields together." The tragic atmosphere 
of the novel is relieved by passages of quaint, primitive humor, by marvelous descriptions of well-to-do rural types. The Dodson family is hardly surpassed in 
fiction. </summary>
  <summary author="Green, Anna Katharine (1846-1935)" title="The Millionaire Baby" print_title="The Millionaire Baby">MILLIONAIRE BABY, THE, by Anna Katharine Green (1905). This is a detective 
story founded on the mysterious disappearance of Gwendolen Ocumpaugh, the only 
child of wealthy parents and heiress to a fortune which gives her the name of the 
"Millionaire Baby." She disappears from a bungalow on the family estate while 
in the charge of her nursery governess, Miss Graham. Mrs. Ocumpaugh is giving 
a large reception at the time the loss of Gwendolen is discovered and frenzied with 
grief she leads the search for the child. The river is dragged, at her suggestion, 
and one small shoe belonging to Gwendolen is found in the bushes and another in 
the river. However, Mr. Trevitt, the private detective, who is at work on the 
case, discovers that the two shoes are for the same foot and immediately scents a 
conspiracy and is convinced that the child has been abducted. In the next house 
to the Ocumpaughs lives an attractive widow, named Mrs. Carew, who on the day 
of the disappearance has been to the city and brought back with her an orphan nephew 
with whom she is to sail immediately for Europe. Mr. Trevitt explores the bungalow 
with Mrs. Carew as she will not permit him to go there without her, and he discovers 
a trap door under a rug which leads to a room underground and finds proof of Gwendolen's having been secreted there. He discovers a woman's footprints which he 
suspects are Mrs. Carew's but on interviewing Mrs. Ocumpaugh she breaks down 
and confesses that they are hers. She tells him that Gwendolen is not her own 
child but has been procured for her by a Dr. Pool who has aided her in deceiving her 
husband as to her real identity. Mr. Ocumpaugh being in Europe at the time of 
the abduction which was precipitated by the threats of Dr. Pool who would force 
her to give up the child, she had finally taken Mrs. Carew into her confidence and 
together they had planned for Gwendolen's disappearance. Mrs. Ocumpaugh 
herself hid her in the bungalow and later carried her to Mrs. Carew's where she 
was dressed as a boy, with her hair cut and darkened. The child Mrs. Carew had 
brought back from the city was surreptitiously carried away in a covered wagon 
and the servants were dismissed for the occasion. 

Mrs. Ocumpaugh, who loves her husband devotedly, is almost crazed at the 
thought of his learning her duplicity, when Dr. Pool suddenly dies, and later developments show that Gwendolyn is Mrs. Carew's own child whom poverty has 
forced her to part with at her birth.</summary>

Forest (1867). Dr. Ravenel, a Sojthern Secessionist, comes North at the beginning of the War, with his daughter Lillie; her Secessionism being more a result of 
local pride and social prejudice than of any deep-seated principle due to thought 
and experience. Her conversion is due, in part, to the influence of her lovers, John 
Carter and Edward Colburne, each in turn her husband, the War making her a 
widow after a short period. With the inexperience of youth, carried away by the 
appearance rather than the reality of perfection, she makes a wrong choice in her 
life companion; but death steps in before her mistake is fully comprehended, The 
character of John Carter, who dies a Brigadier-General, is strongly drawn; his 
excesses of sensuality, his infidelities to his wife, his betrayal of the trust assigned 
him by his government for personal aggrandizement, all cloaked by the personal 
magnetism which blinds those near him, and makes him a popular commander and 
his death a national loss. In contrast to this is the equally strong picture of Edward 
Colburne, a dutiful son, a brave soldier, a faithful lover and friend; meeting his 
enemies in open warfare with the same courage that he displays on the less famous 
battle-ground of inner conflict, where he struggles against his disappointment in 
love, his loss of deserved promotion and distressing conditions after the war, lightened only by the tardy love of the woman to whom he has remained faithful. The 
love episodes are the least interesting of the narrative. There are graphic descriptions of battles, those of Fort Winthrop and Cane River being the most noteworthy; 
cynical annotations of the red-tapeism and blunders of the War Department; and 
humorous sketches of the social life in New Orleans during the Northern occupation, 
with race dashings of aristocracy, Creoles, invaders, and freed negroes, besides many 
amusing anecdotes and details of army life all in De Forest's sharp black and white.</summary>

who is a character who will live for a long time in the memories of those who 
read his words of wisdom. Mr. Dooley is a Chicago Irishman past middle 
age, who lives in Archey Road, where he presides over a small saloon. Having 
left Ireland in his youth, he has witnessed, from his point of vantage, the events 
of the world's history, regarding which he has meditated deeply, and having done 
so is always ready to impart his impressions to his sympathetic friend and comrade, 
Mr. Hennessy, or to answer the searching questions of his neighbor, Mr. McKenna. 
Mr. Dooley has all of an Irishman's shrewdness, combativeness, independence, and 
appreciation of courage and loyalty, and his keen wit and picturesque phraseology 
make his reflections very entertaining reading. Mr. Dooley's national reputation 
was made at the time of the Spanish-American War, when his humorous comments 
with the underlying truth and common-sense which they contained were eagerly 
quoted over the whole country. Besides presenting his impressions of the war, Mr. 
Dooley deals with the various topics of the day, and draws amusing pictures of manifold celebrities from the "new woman" to the expert lawyer and modern child. His 
philosophy, full of wit and humor and yet often possessed of an undercurrent of 
pathos, covers a wide field, and in reading it one cannot fail to be impressed by its 
clear-sighted reasonableness and indomitable common-sense. The author of 'Mr. 
Dooley' has taken his rank among the noted humorists and has made a genuine 
contribution to permanent literature. </summary>

in some respects his greatest novel, is a study of the development of a man's 
higher nature through a woman. Air. Isaacs, an exquisite instrument for another 
soul to play upon, is a high-bred Persian whose real name is Abdul-Hafiz-ben-Isdk. 
He is of a dreamy, spiritual nature, of a disposition lacking but one of the patents 
to nobility reverence for women. As a professed Mussulman he is married to 
three wives, whom he regards with kindly contemptuous tolerance. The first 
person to suggest to him that women may have souls is Paul Griggs, the man who 
tells the story. He meets the beautiful Persian in Simla, India, becomes in a day 
his friend and confidant by virtue of some mysterious spiritual attraction. The 
lesson inculcated by Griggs is soon to be learned by Isaacs. He meets and loves 
a beautiful, noble Englishwoman, a Miss Westonhaugh. Each day draws him 
nearer to her; each day reveals to him the infinite as expressed in her fair soul. She 
returns the love of the mystical, beautiful Persian. The last test of the spirituality 
of his passion is her death. From her death-bed he goes forth with his face to the 
stars. "Think of me," he says, "not as mourning the departed day, but as watching longingly for the first faint dawn of the day eternal. Above all, think of me

the lower middle-class. In this case we have the adventures of a spoiled lad Jack,

as a series of papers in Punch; and were published in book form in 1846. They 
gained at once an enormous popularity, being translated into nearly all European 
languages. The secret of this popularity is not difficult to discover. The book is 
a dramatic embodiment of a world-old matrimonial joke, the late sermons delivered at night-time by a self-martyrized wife. Mrs. Caudle had little in this world 
to call her own but her husband's ears. They were her entire property. When 
Mrs. Caudle died, after thirty years of spouseship, the bereaved Job Caudle resolved 
every night to commit to paper one curtain lecture of his late wife. When he himself died, a small packet of papers was found, inscribed as follows: 

"Curtain lectures delivered in the course of thirty years by Mrs. Margaret 
Caudle, and suffered by Job, her husband." 

A single paragraph will suffice to show how Job suffered: 

"Well, Mr. Caudle, I hope you're in a little better temper than you were this

whistle. But it's like you. I can't speak that you don't try to insult me. Once I

author was twenty years old. The book is one of the "dime novels" of English 
literature; a fantastic medley of ghosis, gore, villains, cheap mysteries, and all the 
stage machinery of flagrant melc drama. Like Airs. Radcliffe's novels, it belongs to 
the class of the pseudoterrific. At the time of its publication, however, its exaggerations were not so apparent. Horace Walpole's 'Castle of Otranto' and Mrs. Radcliffe's 'Mysteries of Udolpho' had popularized the mock-heroic. The air was full 
of horrors. ' The Monk ' seemed to contemporary readers one of the great books of 
the day. That it was not without merit was proved by the verdict of no less an 
authority than Sir Walter Scott, who styled it "no ordinary exertion of genius." 
So great was its fame, that the author to the day of his death was called "Monk" 
Lewis. The hero, Ambrosio, is the abbot of the Capuchins at Madrid, surnamed 
"The Man of Holiness." His pride of righteousness opens him at length to spiritual 
disaster. An infernal spirit assuming the shape of a woman tempts him, and he 
falls. One sin succeeds another until he is utterly ruined. Upon the fabric of the

de Valois, cousin of Louis XV. of France, who is masquerading as Monsieur 
Beaucaire. This accomplished prince, bent upon adventure and desirous of 
having perfect freedom in the choice of a bride, goes to England in the suite 
of the Marquis de Mirepoix disguised as a barber. Arrived at Bath he assumes 
the role of gamester and, while amusing himself, falls in love with the beautiful 
Lady Mary Carlisle. The Duke of Winterset, who is paying his addresses to this 
lady, is trapped by Beaucaire while cheating at cards, and fearful of exposure consents to introduce the supposed barber as his friend, the Duke de Chateaurien, at 
Lady Malbourne's ball, where he charms all by his grace and elegance, and is favored 
by a rose from Lady Mary. His social success is assured from that time and his 
suit for the hand of the fair Mary prospers until he is suddenly set upon by the 
jealous Duke of Winterset and his confederates. Brutally attacked by them in 
the presence of his lady love, who has but just assented to his proposal, Beaucaire 
is accused of being a low-born lackey. After displaying his skilled swordsmanship 
against overwhelming odds, he is borne off by his servants wounded and too faint 
to justify himself in the eyes of Lady Mary, who now turns coldly from him. The 
climax of the tale is reached one week later in the Assembly Room, where a brilliant 
throng gathers to greet the ambassador of Louis XV. and other French nobles. Here, 
Beaucaire, hailed as the Duke of Orleans by his respectful countrymen, confronts 
those who have scorned and derided him and tells his story in the presence of the 
humiliated beauty and the disgraced Duke of Winterset. Then, after announcing 
his intention of wedding, his sweet cousin in France, whose devotion he has previously failed to appreciate, Beaucaire takes leave of the chagrined Lady Mary, who

undisciplined, who live out their restless lives against the background of a narrow 
New England household, composed of a gentle, fading mother, a father wholly absorbed in business and affairs, and a dominant female servant, Temperance. When 
Cassandra returns home from boarding-school, she finds Veronica grown into a pale, 
reticent girl, with unearthly little ways. Veronica *s own love-story begins when 
she meets Ben Somers, a friend of her sister. Both girls are born to tragedy, through 
their passionate, irreconcilable temperament; and the story follows their lives with 
a strange, detached impartiality, which holds the interest of the reader more closely 
than any visible advocacy of the cause of either heroine could do. 'The Morgesons ' is rich in delineation of unusual aspects of character, in a grim New England

husband and her seven children are her world, and with very limited resources she

contrary he is struck with the wonderful qualities of her mother. He proposes to 
Margaret and before leaving tells her that having seen her mother he now realizes 
where she has derived the traits which have won his love. Margaret, who has 
always loved her mother devotedly, now realizes how much happier she is in her 
life of loving service than is Mrs. Carr-Boldt with all her riches. </summary>

Range, are graphically set forth, and a broad picture of these two parallel ranges and 
the intervening Central Valley is indelibly impressed on the reader's mind. At the

hit off to the life, with his irresistibly funny malapropisms. He is a lovable old heart-of-gold, who is always taking off his hat to himself and his office, and absurdly pardons 
every crime except the calling of himself an ass. The scene is laid in Messina. Benedick is just home from the wars. He and Beatrice have had some sparring matches 
before, and thick and fast now fly the tart and merry witticisms between them, 
she "the sauciest, most piquant madcap girl that Shakespeare ever drew," yet 
genuinely sympathetic; he a genial wit who tempts fate by his oaths that he will 
never marry. From the wars comes too, Claudio, brave, but a light-weight fop, 
selfish, and touchy about his honor. He loves Hero, daughter of Leonato. Beatrice 
is the latter's niece, and in his house and orchard the action mostly takes place. The 
gentlemen lay a merry plot to ensnare Beatrice and Benedick. The latter is reading 
in the orchard, and overhears their talk about the violent love of Beatrice for him, 
and how (Hero has said) she would rather die than confess it. The bait is eagerly 
swallowed. Next Beatrice, hearing that Hero and Ursula are talking about her in the 
garden, runs, stooping like a lapwing, and hides her in the honeysuckle arbor. With a 
strange fire in her ears she overhears how desperately in love with her is Benedick. 
The bird is limed; she swears to herself to requite his devotion. Hero's wedding-day 
is fixed: Claudio is the lucky man. But the villain Don John concocts a plot which 
has most painful results for twenty-four hours at least. He takes Claudio and his 
friend Don Pedro to the orchard, and shows them, as it seemed, Hero bidding John's 
follower Borachio a thousand good nights: it is really her maid Margaret in her 
garments. Claudio in a rage allows her to go to church, but before the altar scornfully rejects her. Her father is in despair, Beatrice nobly indignant and incredulous. 
Hero swoons, and the officiating friar advises the giving out that she is dead from the 
shock. Claudio believes it, and hangs verses on her tomb. Meantime Dogberry's 
famous night-watch have overheard Borachio confess the villainous practice of John 
and himself. Then Hero's joyful friends plan a little surprise for Claudio. Leonato 
makes him promise, in reparation, to marry a cousin of Hero's, who turns out to be 
Hero herself come to life. A double wedding follows, for Benedick willingly suffers 
himself to be chaffed for eating his words and becoming "the married man," Yet 
both he and Beatrice vow they take each other only out of pity. </summary>

shrines of Gothic supersitition and in all the dreariness of enchantment: a poetess

  <summary author="Daudet, Alphonse (1840-1897)" title="The Nabob" print_title="The Nabob">NABOB, THE, by Alphonse Daudet (1877). This romance is one of the most highly 
finished of the author's works. Jansoulet, the Nabob, has emigrated to Tunis with 
but half a louis in his pocket. He returns with much more than twenty-five millions; 
and becomes at once the prey of a horde of penniless adventurers, whose greed even 
his extravagant generosity cannot satisfy. His dining-room in the Place Vendome is 
the rendezvous of projectors and schemers from every part of the world, and resembles the Tower of Babel. Dr. Jenkins, the inventor of an infallible pill, persuades 
him to endow his famous Asile de Bethleem, hinting to him that the Cross of the 
Legion of Honor will reward his benevolence; but it is the doctor, and not the poor 
Nabob, who is decorated. Montpavon, an old beau, saves a bank, in which he is a 
partner, from insolvency with the money of the multi-millionaire; the journalist 
Moessard receives a liberal donation for a eulogistic newspaper article: in short, 
Jansoulet becomes the easy dupe of all who approach him. * The Nabob ' is a romance 
of manners and observation; and it blends successfully many of the qualities of both 
the naturalist and the romantic schools. It exhibits a singular faculty for seizing 
on the picturesque side of things, and a wonderful gift of expression. Although several 
models among the French commercial classes must have sat for Jansoulet, most of 
the other characters are prominent figures in Parisian life, very thinly veiled. </summary>
  <summary author="Lessing, Gotthold Ephraim (1729-1781)" title="Nathan the Wise; a dramatic poem in five acts" print_title="Nathan the Wise;\na dramatic poem\nin five acts">NATHAN THE WISE, by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. In this book we see embodied 
Lessing's ideal of the theatre as the pulpit of humanity. The theme is the search for 
truth under all creeds, the protest of natural kinship against the artificial distinctions 
and divisions of mankind on religious grounds, and the elevation of neighborly love 
to the highest place in the Divine favor. The play is called 'A Dramatic Poem in 
Five Acts.' The scene is in Jerusalem. The plot turns upon the fortunes of a 
certain Christian knight in wooing for his bride Recha, the supposed child of the Jew 
Nathan. He had saved her life in a conflagration, and the Jew in gratitude assents 
to the knight's suit; knowing, as the knight does not know, that his ward is a baptized Christian child. The Patriarch, learning of the Jew's concealment of Recha's 
Christian origin, and of her attachment to Nathan and his faith, is ready to have this 
Jew committed to the flames for this crime against religion. The matter is brought 
before the Sultan Saladin for adjustment; and the moral of the drama is focused iix 
the beautiful story related by the Jew to Saladin, of 'The Father and his Ring.' A 
father had a certain very precious ring, which on dying he bequeathed to his favorite 
son, with the instruction that he should do likewise, that so the ring should be 
owned in each generation by the most beloved son. At length the ring comes into 
the possession of a father who has three equally beloved sons, and he knows not to 
which to leave it. Calling a jeweler, he has two other rings made in such exact imitation of the original one that no one could tell the difference, and at his death these 
three rings are owned by the three brothers. But a dispute very soon arises, leading 
to the bitterest hostilities between the brothers, over the question which of the rings 
is the first and genuine one; and a wise judge is called in to settle the controversy. 
Seeing that the rings only breed hatred instead of love, he suggests that the father 
may have destroyed the true one and given them all only imitations; but if this be 
not so, let each one of the brothers vindicate the father's honor by showing that the 
ring he owns has truly the power of attracting not the hatred but the love of others. 
The magnanimity and justice of the Sultan suggest that he is the judge prefigured 
in the legend; but the moral of the play points to the one Divine Arbiter, who alone 
can read the motives and know the true deserts of men and declare who is the 
possessor of the father's ring. 

The play was performed in Berlin two years after the author's death, and was 
coolly received; but it was brought out with success by Goethe and Schiller in Weimar, and has long since taken its place among the classics of German literature.</summary>

Russel Wallace (1870). A volume of essays, ten in number, which were first published in 1855, 1858, 1864, 1867, 1868, and 1869. The first and second of these, 'On

whatever of the scope and nature of Darwin's labors. One or two other persons had 
propounded, as Darwin admits, the principle of natural selection, but had failed to 
see its wide and immensely important applications. Wallace's essays show that he 
had not only noted the principle, but had fully grasped its importance. To some 
extent Wallace's essays, published before Darwin's work on 'The Descent of Man,' 
showed a marked divergence from Darwinian views. In a later reprint, 1891, of his 
'Contributions/ Wallace made alterations and considerable additions. In his 'Darwinism,' 1889, Wallace gave an admirably clear and effective exposition of Darwin's

  <summary author="Southey, Robert (1774-1843)" title="The Life of Horatio, Lord Nelson" print_title="The Life of Horatio,\nLord Nelson">NELSON, THE LIFE OF, by Robert Southey (1813). The life of Nelson, written 
to provide young seamen with a clear concise account of the exploits of England's 
greatest hero, is a model among short biographies, and a classic in English literature. 
It is considered the author's masterpiece. "The best eulogy of Nelson" Southey 
writes, "is the faithful history of his actions; the best history that which shall relate 
them most perspicuously." A special edition was published by the American 
government and a copy issued to every seaman and every officer in the American 
navy. Nelson's splendid career is the very stuff of biography. The story begins 
with anecdotes of his boyhood which give proof of his courage and indomitable will. 
He was twelve years old when he first went to sea with his uncle Captain Suckling. 
His life was an uninterrupted effort to be the best man at his work, and his promotion 
was rapid. He was a captain when he was twenty-one, and an admiral before he was 
thirty. Nelson never had good health and on a voyage to India he was so affected 
by the climate that he was obliged to return home. On this return voyage one day 
after a long and gloomy reverie, he experienced a sudden glow of patriotism and 
exclaimed, "I will be a hero! and confiding in Providence brave every danger." 
The incidents of his life reveal his fascinating personality, his devotion to his country 
and to his men, and his heroism and leadership in battle. The three greatest naval 
successes, the battle of the Nile, the victory of Copenhagen, and of Trafalgar, when 
Nelson received his death wound, are fully and interestingly described. Napoleon
had transported the best French army to Egypt for Eastern conquest, depending on 
his fleet for his means of communication. Nelson destroyed thirteen out of trie 
seventeen French ships, rendering the army in Egypt useless. The victory or 
Copenhagen shattered the Northern coalition and freed England from pressing dan 
ger. The incident of Nelson clapping his telescope to his blind eye in order not to 
see the signal to cease firing is a story of the Copenhagen attack. Trafalgar was the 
battle which rendered an invasion of England by Napoleon impossible and made 
England mistress of the seas. It was at Trafalgar that he made his famous signal 
before going into action, "England expects that every man will do his duty," the 
signal which Southey says so truly "will be remembered as long as the language, or 
even the memory of England shall endure. " The story of his personal life is his 
marriage and his romantic attachment to the beautiful Lady Hamilton for whose 
sake he separated from his wife. Nelson died in the hour of victory. With characteristic self-forgetfulness, he insisted that the surgeon should leave him and attend 
to those to whom he might be useful, for he said, "you can do nothing for me. " His
last words were, "Thank God, I have done my duty." "So perfectly, indeed, had 
he performed his part, that the maritime war, after the battle of Trafalgar, 'the most 
signal victory that ever was achieved upon the seas,' was considered at an end: the 
fleets of the enemy were not merely defeated, but destroyed," and by the destruction 
of this mighty fleet, "all the maritime schemes of France were totally frustrated." 
It is a clear and charmingly written narrative, perhaps never surpassed for the 
perfection of its prose style.</summary>

named Norvin Blake had gone to attend the wedding of his friend Martel Savigno. 
The two men had met in Paris and had become such warm friends that Blake had 
taken this long journey in order to be Mart el's best man. Upon meeting his friend's 
fiance'e, Countess Margherita Ginini, Blake is impressed by her great beauty and 
charm, and a feeling is aroused within him which no other woman had ever evoked. 
As the days go by he finds himself deeply in love with his friend's fiance'e, but endeavors to smother his traitorous feelings. On the eve of the wedding while Blake, 
Martel, and his steward are returning home, they are attacked in a lonely place by 
members of the Mafia Society, whom Martel has offended, and he and his steward 
are killed. Blake escapes, but blames himself for cowardice in not having been able 
to help his friend. The Countess Margherita is heart-broken at the loss of her lover 
and declares that she will find the murderers and avenge Mart el's death. Blake 
is recalled to America by the illness and death of his mother and when he returns 
to Sicily eight months later, finds Margherita gone, having left no clue to her whereabouts. Blake starts an unsuccessful search, but finding she has sailed for America 
he returns to his own country. After four years of unavailing search Blake is found

  <summary author="Wilson, Woodrow (1856-1924)" title="The New Freedom" print_title="The New Freedom">NEW FREEDOM, THE, 'A Call for the Emancipation of the Generous Energies of a 
People,' is a collection of political essays put together by William Bayard Hale from 
speeches delivered by Woodrow Wilson during his campaign for the Presidency in 
1912 and shortly after his election. In a clear, direct style with homely and concrete 
illustrations they present certain principles of democratic government as evolved 
by the author during his experience with trusts and professional politicians when 
governor of New Jersey. These principles he applies to the issues of the 1912 campaign, representing the Republicans and the Progressives as supporters of monopoly, 
special privilege, and government by trusteeship and the Democrats as the defenders 
of individual opportunity, fair competition, and direct popular government. The 
trust, the tariff, and the political boss are the three institutions which are subjected 
in this volume to a trenchant and vigorous attack. While praising the legitimate 
co-ordination of business enterprises in the interests of economy and efficiency Mr. 
Wilson denounces those combinations which aim simply at the increase of private 
gain through the suppression of competition and actually weaken efficiency by refusing to adopt new inventions lest they involve the alteration of existing machinery. 
He maintains that such trusts must be made impossible by public investigation and 
control. As to the protective tariff, he denounces not its principle but its abuse for 
the benefit of trust and monopoly. Tariff taxes enable manufacturers to escape 
foreign competition; as a result they are unchecked in the formation of illegal combinations and are enabled to raise the prices to the consumer and to reduce wages 
to the laborer. All tariff schedules should be revised with a view to withdrawing 
protection from such industries but not to destroying the principle of protection itself. 
Finally the bosses and the political machines which they have created so operate as to 
take the control of affairs away from the parties and from the people, and to lodge 
it with a small group of corrupt interests. For this abuse Mr. Wilson's remedies
are the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. These enable the people on the 
petition of a reasonable number to intervene when legislatures and officials have 
become tools of the bosses, to introduce or to veto legislation, and to remove persons 
who have been unfaithful to their trust. These rights, however, he thinks need not 
be often invoked, and need not extend to the judiciary. In attacking these abuses 
just outlined the author is especially aiming at the tendency of all business and all 
politics to fall under the control of a small group of wealthy men, who "have constituted 
themselves trustees for the people and desire to organize and direct their economic, 
social, and legislative activities. Against this tendency Mr. Wilson sets the old 
American principle of freedom and individual opportunity, showing, however, that 
in^this new age new conditions of business have arisen which make necessary a revision of the laws and legislation by which freedom and opportunity are secured." The 
new freedom" is to be won by "taking common counsel," i.e., by open democratic 
discussion, by the revival of a sturdy spirit of independence and self-reliance, and 
by adequate policing and publicity on the part of the government against those 
who would bring the American people under their tutelage.</summary>
  <summary author="Gissing, George (1857-1903)" title="New Grub Street" print_title="New Grub Street">NEW GRUB STREET, a novel by George Gissing (1891). The author paints 
on a broad and diversified canvas the struggle for existence in the English literary 
world of his day. The general conception is that in the modern Grub Street success 
is assured only by adopting the most frankly utilitarian and mercenary ideals. The 
author must write what the public wants and is willing to pay for, without consulting 
his artistic conscience; and he must employ every art of self-advertisement and of 
acquiring influential friends in order to gain that apparent prosperity which alone 
can win him a fair hearing. The encumbrance of marriage to a woman of no fortune 
is not to be thought of. Poverty, in fact, is regarded in this book as an unmitigated 
evil, a hindrance to physical cleanliness and health, domestic happiness, personal 
amenity, and the development of a fine character and creative artistic work. The 
dramatis persona include representatives of various types who labor under the dome 
of the British Museum, in cheerless garrets and narrow middle-class, lodgings, 
novelists, reviewers, literary hacks, writers of books about books, literary advisers 
unable to write successfully themselves all with the self-conscious introspection 
common to literary men and many with their bitter enmities. The two most prominent characters are Jasper Milvain, a clever reviewer and essayist, who frankly 
accepts the materialistic standards of the New Grub Street and wins social and literary 
success; and Edwin Reardon, a highly "temperamental" and conscientious novelist, 
who refuses to sacrifice his artistic ideals to the popular taste, writes two fine but 
unappreciated books, and then through financial worry and his wife's lack of sympathy with his resolute stand against cheapening his art, falls into a condition of 
nervous depression which not only makes work impossible but leads to the separation 
of husband and wife and his death from privation and despair. A legacy which comes 
to his wife and an ensuing reconciliation with her come too late to restore him to 
health. Jasper is an admirer of Mrs. Reardon's cousin, Marian Yule, daughter of 
Alfred Yule, a literary editor and reviewer of the old stamp, immensely learned and 
industrious but pedantic and without brilliancy, and embittered by his lack of 
recognition, which is due in part to his having married beneath him. Marian has been 
brought up to assist her father and spends her time working in the British Museum. 
She loves Jasper, and a sum of 5000 to which she falls heir makes it seem possible to 
him to propose to her without injury to his literary career. The legacy, however, 
proves to have been in large part exhausted by bad investments; and her father,
becoming blind, needs to be assisted with what remains. Jasper, therefore, having 
first unsuccessfully made advances to an heiress without the knowledge of his fiancee, 
withdraws from the engagement and at length marries Amy Reardon, widow of his 
friend the unsuccessful novelist. From the same source as Marian she has inherited 
10,000 which remain intact, and the couple enter on a social career which bids fair 
to end in high literary distinction. Interesting minor characters are Milvain's two 
sisters, Maud and Dora, who come to London to support themselves by writing 
children's books. They make marriages, the first to a man of some wealth and the 
second to Whelpdale, a literary adventurer whose experiences as a writer for American 
newspapers are borrowed from those of Gissing himself. Another character, Harold 
Biffen, a penniless scholar, lives in destitution and supports himself by tutoring poor 
clerks for civil-service examinations. He is a man of fine, generous temperament, 
keen literary sensibilities, and excellent classical scholarship, and he loves life in all 
its manifestations. He is at work on a novel entitled 'Mr. Bailey, Grocer,' which is 
without plot or embellishment, but sets forth "absolute realism in the sphere of the 
ignobly decent." The formula might well stand for much that is characteristic of 
Gissing's own work. After long months of hunger and privation the book is finished, 
rescued by Biffen from a fire, and submitted to the publishers, one of whom pays a 
small sum for it. With the public it is a failure. Biffen is a faithful companion of 
Reardon in his miseries and is present at his death, which occurs at Brighton just 
after the reconciliation with his wife. Later, Biffen, overcome by the beauty of Amy 
Reardon and her sympathy for him, falls hopelessly in love with her, and feeling 
himself alone in the world and without object in life, takes poison and dies on Putney 
Heath. The book is somewhat ill-constructed as regards temporal sequence and the 
shifting of point of view from one group of characters to another. Nor will it appeal 
to those who enjoy a cheerful atmosphere and a happy ending. But it is a powerful 
picture of a phase of life, which it treats with sober and convincing realism; and it 
contains some exceedingly human personages, a number of absorbing events, and 
many thorough analyses of character and temperament.</summary>

a man named Richard Remington, who at the age of forty-three reviews his past 
experiences in a most detailed manner. Born in Kent, England, the son of an unconventional father, and a narrow and strait-laced mother, the boy grows up amid 
conflicting influences an introspective and studiously inclined youth. Orphaned 
at the age of sixteen, he works out his later career with little interference from outside 
sources; he goes to college, and develops a taste for writing, and early becomes a 
successful author. He marries a rich and attractive girl named Margaret Seddon, 
who is deeply in love with him, and who willingly overlooks his past affairs with 
women which he confesses when he proposes to her. Margaret is a sweet and high-minded woman with ambition to aid her husband in his career. Assisted by her 
money and influence, Remington secures a seat in Parliament as a Liberal. Margaret is deeply interested in this party and is greatly disappointed when later her 
husband swings over to the Conservative side. This causes a widening of the breach 
which has been growing up between them, as Remington's love for his wife has been 
gradually lessening in spite of her devotion to him. A new interest has come into his 
life through his friendship with Isabel Rivers, a brilliant and independent girl, whom 
he had known in her school-girl days and had seen blossom into womanhood. Isabel's 
advanced thought and strong and impulsive nature appeal strongly to Remington, 
who soon finds himself passionately in love with her, and she reciprocates his feelings.

They succeed in keeping their secret for some time, but finally it becomes a public 
scandal and they realize that their relations must cease if Remington is to continue his 
public career. They decide not to meet again, and Isabel is on the point of marrying 
another man, when their infatuation reasserts itself and they are unable to resist it. 
They elope, and fly to a foreign land, and by so doing, Remington sacrifices his 
political career which had promised to bring him honor and glory, and while he can 
but look back with regret to the busy world that he has relinquished he contents 
himself with his overmastering passion for Isabel.</summary>
  <summary author="Wells, H. G. (Herbert George) (1866-1946)" title="New Worlds For Old: A Plain Account of Modern Socialism" print_title="New Worlds For Old:\nA Plain Account of\nModern Socialism">NEW WORLDS FOR OLD, by H. G. Wells (1908), is a popular exposition of 
socialism for the general reader. The author is a moderate socialist, believing in ths 
gradual introduction of socialism though government control of industry not with 
Marx in an immediate economic revolution. He advocates the taking over by the 
government of all public utilities, the heavy taxation of large fortunes, the establishment of a minimum wage, and the assumption by the state of full responsibility for 
the care of children, including education, and vocational training, for the support of 
expectant mothers, and aged persons, for attendance upon the sick. Yet he would 
not do away with the family or with private property, and he believes that the advantages of both these institutions would be much more widely and equally distributed 
under the system that he proposes than at present, when such a large proportion of 
families live in filth, penury, and demoralizing conditions and when the majority of 
people are constantly haunted by the fear of poverty. The various stock objections 
to socialism, as for example its opposition to the biological law of the survival of the 
fittest and to the acquisitive instincts of human nature, are effectively answered; 
and an excellent case is made out for the progressive administrative socialism in which 
the author firmly believes. The positions taken are supported by many interesting 
citations from sociological investigations among the poor and other data of a statistic 
kind. The fluent, informal, conversational style and the ready illustration of 
principles by instances and topics of homely, every-day occurrence make the book 
eminently readable. It is inspired by a real enthusiasm and by faith in the power of 
science to solve sociological problems, and it gives a very good idea of the essence of 
socialism. </summary>

has many claims to greatness. It not only presents a most lifelike and convincing 
picture of English society in the first half of the century, but it excels in the drawing 
of individual types. Colonel Newcome, perhaps the most perfect type of a gentleman to be found in the whole range of fiction, sheds undying lustre upon the novel. 
Ethel Newcome is one of the rare women of fiction who really live as much in the 
reader's consciousness as in the conception of the author. Clive Newcome is also 
possessed of abundant life. His strong and faulty humanity is the proof of his 
genuineness. 

All the world knows his story, beginning with the bravery of boyhood just released 
rom the dim cloisters of Grey Friars. His father, Colonel Newcome, has come from 
jidia to rejoice in him as in a precious possession, and to renew his old associations 
n London for the sake of his son. Clive's career, on which so many hopes are built, 
s marred with failures. He loves his cousin Ethel Newcome, but she is hedged from 
lim by the ambitions of her family. He himself makes a wretched marriage. His 
Ireams of success as an artist fade away. The Colonel loses his fortune, and in his
old age becomes a pensioner of Grey Friars. The quiet pathos of his death-bed scene 
is unique, even in Thackeray. With the word "Adsum" upon his lips, the word 
with which he used to answer the roll-call as a boy at school, he passes into peace. 
Clive and Ethel, each free to begin the world again, meet at his death-bed. The 
novel closes upon their chastened happiness. No words of praise or criticism, no 
detailed description, can convey the sense of the light and sweetness of "The Newcomes." As a novel of English upper and middle class life, it remains without a rival.</summary>
  <summary author="Anonymous" title="The Nibelungenlied" print_title="The Nibelungenlied">NIBELUNGENLIED, THE, an epic poem in Middle High German, composed 
by an unknown poet at the end of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth 
century. Earlier ballads or lays furnished the basis of the story, which is now regarded, however, as the unified production of a single author not a conglomeration 
of individual poems. The theme, which originated in the primitive folk-lore of the 
Teutonic peoples and the internecine warfare of the Period of the Migrations, was 
known by all the Germanic nations, and received literary treatment in the Scandinavian eddas and sagas as well as in the Nibelungenlied. Siegfried, a warrior endowed with surpassing bravery and magic powers is treacherously slain by Hagen at 
the instigation of Brunhild in vengeance for the deception by which Siegfried had 
obtained her as wife for King Gunther of Burgundy. Siegfried's widow, Kriemhild, 
sister of Gunther and Hagen, marries Etel (Attila), "King of the Huns, invites her 
brothers and their train to the court of Attila, and there has them massacred, falling 
herself in the melee. The poem consists of nearly 2400 four-line strophes, the first 
line rhyming with the second and the third with the fourth. The lines are divided 
by a caesura into two halves, each half containing three accented syllables, with the 
exception of the last half of the fourth line, which contains four accented syllables. 
The language of the Nibelungenlied differs from Modern High German about as that 
of Chaucer does from Modern English. The best translations into Modern High 
German are those by Simrock and Bartsch. Some English versions are W. N. 
Lettsom's (1850, new ed., 1903), Foster-Barham's (1887), Alice Horton's (1888), 
Birch's (1895), G. H. Needler's (1905 reproducing exactly the original metre), D. B, 
Shumway's (1909 in archaic prose), and A. S. Way's (1911 in Morris's long 
couplets without strophes).</summary>

Bird, M.D. (1837). This is a tale of Kentucky during the "dark and bloody" days,
and was especially popular about the middle of the nineteenth century. A play, 
founded upon this narrative, was received with boundless applause, held the stage 
(a certain grade of stage) for many years, and was a forerunner of the dime novel in 
stimulating an unhealthy desire among boys to run away from home and go West to 
kill Indians. 

From that fateful day in his boyhood, when he saw his home destroyed and his 
relatives and friends brutally butchered by red fiends, Nick devotes his life to revenge. 
Eventually he kills every member of the band of Indians that desolated his home, while 
hundreds of other savages also fall by his hand. He marks each victim by a rude 
cross cut upon the breast. The red men look upon him as the Jibbenainosay, an 
Indian devil; believing that such wholesale slaughter, by an unseen and undetected 
foe, must be the work of supernatural powers. 

The author has been taken to task by critics who complain that he pictures the 
red man upon a plane far below that of the noble savage described by Cooper and 
others. Bird replies that he describes the cruel, treacherous, and vindictive Indian 
as he exists, and not the ideal creation of a novelist. Experienced frontiersmen, with 
practical unanimity, indorse the estimate of Indian character presented in this book; 
but it must be said that neither portrait of the North-American Indian does him 
justice. Perhaps some educated Red Man will one day draw the picture of the 
"frontiersman."</summary>

'Premier Recit. La Guerre Civile,' and was intended to form the first part of a 
trilogy. It was published in 1874. The edition of 1882 contains several remarkable 
designs signed by the author. The story deals with an episode of the Vendean and 
Breton insurrection; the scene opening in a wood in Bretagne where a woman, driven 
distracted by the war raging around herself and her three children, encounters a 
body of republican soldiers. During this time, a band of emigres are preparing to land 
under the command of a Breton nobleman, the Marquis de Lantenac. The English 
government, though it has furnished them with a ship, informs the French authorities 
of their design, and a flotilla bars their passage. The emigres, after securing the escape 
of Lantenac, who is commissioned to raise Bretagne, blow up the vessel. After landing 
he learns that a price is set on his head. A number of men come towards him and he 
believes he is lost, but bravely tells his name. They are Bretons, and recognize him as 
their leader. Then ensues a conflict in which the marquis is victorious, and in which 
no quarter is given except to the three children, whom the Bretons carry to La Tourgue 
as hostages. La Tourgue is besieged by the republican troops under Gauvain, the 
marquis's nephew, assisted by the ex-priest Cimourdain, a rigid and inflexible republican who has trained Gauvain in his own opinions. The besieged are determined 
to blow up the tower and all it contains, if they are conquered. When their case is 
desperate and the tower is already on fire, an underground passage is discovered, and 
they can escape. Lantenac is in safety, but he hears the agonizing shrieks of the 
mother, who sees her three children in the midst of the flames. Moved with pity, he 
returns, saves them, and becomes a prisoner. When he is about to be executed, 
Gauvain covers him with his warm cloak, tells him to depart, and remains in his place.

A council of war condemns Gauvain; and at the moment he mounts the scaffold, 
Cimourdain, who was one of his judges, kills himself. Hugo 'incarnates in his three 
principal characters the three ages of human society. Lantenac the monarchic chief 
personifies the past; Cimourdain, the citizen priest, the present; and Gauvain, the 
ideal of mercy, the future. Although the descriptions and disquisitions are sometimes 
wordy and tedious and there are many improbabilities in the romance, the picture 
of the three little children tossed about in the revolutionary hurricane will always be 
considered one of the loftiest achievements of Hugo's genius. The account of the 
convention of 1793, and the conversations of Marat, Danton, and Robespierre, also 
show the hand of a master. </summary>
  <summary author="Baring-Gould, S. (Sabine) (1834-1924)" title="Noémi" print_title="Noemi">NOEMI, by S. Baring-Gould (1895), is a tale of Aquitaine, during the English occupation, in the early fifteenth century. The country was in a state of civil war; and free 
companies, nominally fighting for French or English, but in reality for their own 
pockets, mere plunderers and bandits, flourished mightily. The most dreaded freebooter in the valley of the Dordogne was Le Gros Guillem, who from his stronghold 
at Domme sweeps down upon the farms and hamlets below; till at length the timid 
peasants, finding a leader in Ogier del' Peyra, a petty sieur of the neighborhood, rise 
up against their scourge, destroy his rocky fastness, and put his men to death or flight. 
Guillem's daughter, Noemi, a madcap beauty, joins her father's band of ruffians; but 
soon sickens of their deeds, and risks her life to save Ogier from the oubliette, because 
she loves his son. The book is filled with thrilling and bloody incident, culminating 
in the storming of L'Eglise Guillem, as the freebooter's den is ironically called, and 
the strange death of the robber chieftain. The descriptions of the wild valley of the 
Dordogne, and the life of the outlaws, are striking; and the pretty love story, set 
against this background, very attractive. As a picture of a fierce and horrible 
period, it is hardly less vivid than the 'White Company' of Conan Doyle.</summary>
  <summary author="Conrad, Joseph (1857-1924)" title="Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard" print_title="Nostromo:\nA Tale of the Seaboard">NOSTROMO; A TALE OF THE SEABOARD, by Joseph Conrad. The scene of 
this tale of silver mine, buried treasure, and revolutions is a South American republic. 
The silver mine was a government concession forced upon an English family living in 
Costaguana. Charles Gould, the last of the family, brings foreign capital, builds 
a railroad, takes the state politicians on his unofficial pay-roll, and makes the 
family white elephant a valuable property. The political party out of power dislike 
the reign of law and order, which follows, and start a revolution in a desperate attempt 
to gain possession of the mine, now the "treasure house of the world." Silver 
enough to buy a kingdom is waiting shipment at the wharf, and to prevent it becoming spoils to the invader, Charles Gould decides to hide the ingots on one of the 
islands at the entrance of the harbor. The man chosen for this enterprise is Nostromo, 
an Italian sailor, foreman of the wharf. Nostromo has come to Costaguana to make 
his fortune, and thus far his fortune is his good reputation. His pride and joy is to 
be "well spoken of." He is the hero of the populace of Italians and natives and has 
the confidence and esteem of the English and Spanish residents and officials. To his 
romantic imagination this will be the most famous and desperate affair of his life, 
which will be talked about "from one end of America to the other." His boat is 
nearly run down in the night by the steamer bringing the attacking soldiers, but he 
succeeds in getting to the island and burying the treasure. When he returns the 
rebels are in possession and he finds himself a political fugitive and penniless. It is 
assumed by the Goulds that the silver has been lost at sea, and Nostromo realizes that 
the buried treasure is his secret. Charles Gould saves the Gould concession, the 
development of which has become the ruling passion of his life, by presenting the 
winning argument of tons of dynamite ready to blow up the silver mountain in case 
of attack. Nostromo is entrusted with the dangerous mission of getting help from the 
government troops. He makes a spectacular dash from the town on an engine up 
the mountain, over the mountains on horseback to the capital, and returns with the 
soldiers by sea in time to save the day. Nostromo visits his treasure island at night, 
and carries away the silver ingots, which he disposes of in distant ports. A lighthouse 
is built on the island, but Nostromo arranges that his old friend, Viola, shall be the 
keeper. Nostromo loves Giselle, Viola's younger daughter, but is betrothed to the 
older daughter, Linda. As soon as he has removed a fortune from the buried treasure, 
he expects to run away with Giselle. He cannot resist coming to the lighthouse at 
night to see his sweetheart, and is shot by Viola who mistakes him for a night prowler. 
The once "incorruptible" Nostromo dies a thief, and the inevitable curse of buried 
treasure is thus fulfilled. 

Such in brief is the main plot of the novel, but it is not merely the story of Nostromo and his life but it rather includes the stories of all concerned with the silver 
mine, Conrad's power of realizing the intricacies and entanglements of both character and incident is nowhere better displayed than here in this amazing creation of 
a South American State.</summary>
  <summary author="Hugo, Victor (1802-1885)" title="Notre-Dame De Paris" print_title="Notre-Dame of Paris">NOTRE-DAME OF PARIS, by Victor Hugo (1830), relates a romance growing 
up in and around the cathedral of that name. More than this, the mighty building, 
dating back at least to the eleventh century, and enriched with thirteenth-century 
glass, seems to fill the author's vision and dominate his mind from beginning to end; 
just as it dominates, from its immemorial island, the overflowing city for which he 
wrote. Among his different conceptions of Notre- Dame folding over and fitting 
into each otherhe brings out most clearly of all the truth that the cathedral of 
the Middle Ages was the book of the people; and that since the dawn of printing,
books have taken the place of those marvelously involved and inexhaustible carvings, 
where the smoldering passions of the multitude, their humor and irreligion as well 
as their religion and poetic emotion, found continual expression. Even necromancy 
and astrology wreathed themselves in fantastic figures around the great doorway 
of Notre-Dame. 

To the reader who loses himself in the atmosphere thus created, the world is 
Prance, France is Paris, Paris is the cathedral. He is taken through the aisles 
and galleries, out on the roof, up in the towers, and into every nook and comer of 
the church; then lovingly, faithfully, scrupulously through the squares or crossroads of the old city, along crooked streets that have vanished, and thoroughfares 
still existing, like Rue Saint- Jacques or Rue Saint-Denis, which it calls the arteries 
of Paris. Thus it may be taken as a fifteenth-century guide-book of the town, 
answering all the purposes of a Baedeker; not only giving the general topography 
but touching on nearly every structure then standing, from the Bastile to the gibbet 
of Montfaucon. 

To Quasimodo, the deaf and deformed bell-ringer of the cathedral, "stunted, 
limping, blind in one eye," the great church is an object of extravagant devotion 
and superstitious awe. Its arch-deacon alone had pity on him when he lay, a miserable foundling, at its door; it is all the home he has ever known, and he leads a 
strange existence among the statues and gargoyles within and without. Sometimes, 
when he is skulking among them, the great interior seems alive and trembling, like 
some huge animal an elephant, perhaps, but not an unfriendly one. In such 
passages the poet romancer gives his wild fancy full rein. 

No less than 'Faust,' the story is a phantasmagoria, in which a learned goat 
has a role of importance, everywhere accompanying the heroine, Esmeralda, a beautiful, innocent, and incorruptible singer and dancer of sixteen summers. 

This many-sided book may also be regarded as an eloquent condemnation of 
capital punishment; of all forms of capital punishment, perhaps, or the writer would 
hardly say in 1831 that the vast resources of the chamber of torture have been reduced in his day to a sneaking guillotine that only shows its head at intervals. Or, 
quite as fairly, the book may be regarded as a sermon against celibacy, since it 
never loses sight of the effect of monastic vows on the ardent though ascetic archdeacon of the cathedral, Claude Frollo. The avowed motive of the story is the 
workings of fate, in whose toils nearly all the chief characters are inextricably caught. 
The keynote is given in the word andgke, the Greek equivalent of kismet or fate, 
which the author if his introduction is to be taken seriously found rudely scrawled 
on the wall of a cell in one of the cathedral towers. Like Walter Scott's 'Quentin 
Durward,' and Theodore de Banville's exquisite play of 'Gringoire,' 'Notre-Dame' 
contains a searching study of the treacherous but able monarch, Louis XL, and 
his barber Olivier-le-Daim. </summary>
  <summary author="Bacon, Francis (1561-1626)" title="Novum Organum Or True Suggestions for the Interpretation of Nature" print_title="Novum Organum\nOr\nTrue Suggestions\nfor the\nInterpretation of Nature">NOVUM ORGANUM, THE, by Francis Bacon. The 'Novum Organum,' or 
'New Method, ' forms the second part of Lord Bacon's great philosophical work 
entitled 'Instauratio Magna,' 'The Great Restoration' of Science. The first part, 
entitled 'De Augmentis Scientiarum,' is an extension of the previous work on the 
Advancement of Learning. The third part is the 'Historia Naturalis.' The 'Novum Organum' contains the outlines of the scientific and inductive method; viz. 
that of proceeding from facts to general laws, instead of inferring facts from assumed 
general principles which have never been proved. This latter, the philosophical 
and metaphysical method, was repudiated by Bacon, and together with the "superstitions " of theology, was declared to have no place in the new learning. The 'New 
Method,' therefore, is an attempt at an interpretation of nature from direct observation. "Nature," says Bacon, "we behold by a direct ray; God by a refracted 
ray; man by a reflected ray." At the beginning of the 'Novum Organum' we read 
this first of the series of 180 Aphorisms of which its two books consist: "Man, the 
minister and interpreter of Nature, can do and understand only so much as he 
has observed in her: more he can neither know nor do." As obstacles to correct 
observation and inference from nature, he mentions the four kinds of "Idola," 
or preconceptions which prejudice the mind at the outset and which must, therefore, be removed: the Idola Tribus, or the misconceptions growing out of our nature 
as mart; the Idola Specus, those growing out of our individual or peculiar nature 
or surroundings; the Idola Fori, misconceptions imbibed through common speech 
and opinions leading to much idle controversy; and finally the Idola Theatri, or 
fables and fictions of tradition that continue to be sources of error. He refers contemptuously to the Greek Sophists, and quotes the prophecy of the Egyptian priest 
concerning the Greeks: "They are always boys: they have neither the age of science 
nor the science of age." 

The second part begins with the Aphorism, "It is the work and intention of 
human power to generate and superinduce a new nature or new natures upon a body 
already given: but of a nature already given to discover a form or a true difference, 
or a nature originating another nature (naturam naturantem) or a source of emanation, this is the work and intention of human learning." The study of forms is 
therefore the object of the new method; and the remainder of the work is devoted 
to illustrating, particularly by observations of the action of heat, the true mode of 
making and comparing observations of natural occurrences. In conclusion the 
author refers to man's fall from a primitive state of innocence and his loss of his 
dominion over nature. This is however capable of restoration first by religion and
faith and then by the arts and sciences. For labor is not always to be a curse, but 
man shall "eat his bread in the sweat of his brow," not indeed in vain disputations 
and idle ceremonies of magic, but in subduing nature to the uses of human life. </summary>
  <summary author="Norris, Frank (1870-1902)" title="The Octopus: A Story of California" print_title="The Octopus:\nA Story of California">OCTOPUS, THE, 'a Story of California,' by Frank Norris (1901). This book 
has for its central motive Wheat, the great source of American power and 
prosperity, and also the literal staff of life. The volume deals with the production
unfilial son Polynices, and his sublime dramatic apotheosis. But the beauty of 
the tragedy consists especially in the ideal representation of the noblest sentiments: 
the majesty of the aged hero, now reduced to beg for bread; the gentle piety of 
Antigone; the artlessness of the rustic chorus, at first appalled by the mere name of 
the stranger, but soon, at the request of Theseus, to give him a most gracious and hospitable reception; finally, the luminous background where Athens appears to the 
patriotic eyes of her poet in all her dazzling splendor. GEdipus, the victim of his 
sons' ingratitude, has sometimes been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. But 
while the two characters are almost equal in tragic grandeur, there is always a reserve, a self-restraint, in the stormiest scenes of the Greek dramatist which is absent 
from the English play.</summary>
  <summary author="Sologub, Fyodor (1863-1927)" title="The Old House and Other Tales" print_title="The Old House\nand Other Tales">OLD HOUSE, THE, by Feodor Sologub (1915). The story of 'The Old House' 
tells about a young student, Boris, led into revolutionary activities by a spy, betrayed 
and hanged. His grandmother, mother, and sister left alone in the "Old House" 
refuse to believe that he is dead, and keep up a pretense of awaiting his return, refusing to remember his tragic fate. All the other stories are uncanny and mysterious, either about the supernatural, or obsessions which lead to happiness in madness. 
In one story a ragged old man watches a little boy playing with a hoop. He finds 
the hoop of an old barrel and takes it to the woods, where unseen he imitates the 
boy, and plays at being a child again, "small, beloved, and happy." The story of 
'Lights and Shadows' tells of an imaginative child who plays at making shadows on 
the wall with his fingers until he loses interest in everything else. His mother 
plays with the shadows with him in the evenings to induce him to study his lessons 
later, and she also becomes the prey of the "persistent, importunate shadows." 
'The White Mother' in the story with this title is the dead sweetheart of a bachelor, 
to whom she appears in dreams. He adopts a little boy who resembles her and 
finds happiness again.</summary>

PAUL'S, by William Harrison Ainsworth. This historical story, dealing with the horrors of the plague which depopulated London in 1665, was published 
in 1841. The old cathedral of St. Paul's is made the scene of various adventures. 
The plot recounts the many attempts of the profligate Earl of Rochester to obtain 
possession of Amabel Bloundel, the beautiful daughter of a London grocer. The 
hero is Leonard Holt, an apprentice of the grocer, who is in love with Amabel but 
is rejected. The Earl is finally successful and carries off Amabel, to whom he is 
married. She, like many of the other characters, dies of the plague. 

Leonard Holt frustrates the Earl's attempts until he is himself stricken with the 
plague; but he recovers from it and lives to save the life of King Charles during the 
great fire of London, of which historical event a graphic description closes the story. 
Leonard, in return for his services to the King, is created Baron Argentine; and 
marries a lady of title, who at the opening of the story is supposed to be the daughter

  <summary author="Turgenev, Ivan Sergeevich (1818-1883)" title="On the Eve: A Novel" print_title="On the Eve:\nA Novel">ON THE EVE, by Ivan Tuigeneff (1589). In this tale which is devoid of plot, 
but full of Turgenev s charm of style and delicate character-drawing, he seeks 
to show the contrast between the dilettante trifling or learned pedantry of young 
Russia, and the intense vitality of conviction in the youth of other nations. He 
first introduces two young Russians, Andre Bersieneff, a doctor of philosophy from 
the Moscow University, and Paul Schubin, a gay and pleasure-loving artist, who has 
been modeling the bust of a beautiful girl, Elena Strashof, whose charms he dwells 
upon. She is the daughter of a dissipated noble; and her mother, a faded society 
belle, has left her to the care of a sentimental governess. The ardent girl, filled with 
high aspirations, rebels at the prosaic routine of her life, and longs for intercourse 
with nobler natures. Both the young men are in love with her, but she despises 
Shubin as a trifler; and just as she is beginning to be interested in the young philosopher Bersieneff, the real hero appears on the scene. This is Dmetri Insarof, a 
young Bulgarian patriot, whose life is devoted to freeing his country from the yoke 
of Turkey. His mother has fallen a victim to the brutality of a Turkish aga, while 
his father was shot in trying to avenge her; and he is now looked upon by his compatriots as their destined leader in the approaching revolt. His tragic story and 
his high aims appeal to Elena's idealism; but Insarof, finding that "on the eve" 
of the great conflict, he is distracted from his mission by love for Elena, has resolved 
to leave her forever without a farewell. She, however, seeks him out, and avows 
her devotion to him, and her willingness to abandon home and country for his sake. 
In his struggle between his passion for her and his dread of involving her in perils 
and hardships, he falls dangerously ill. His comrade and former rival Bersieneff 
nurses him with disinterested friendship until he is partially restored to health, when 
he and Elena are married secretly, owing to the opposition of her family to the 
foreign adventurer. They start together for Bulgaria to take part in the struggle 
for his fatherland, but have only reached Venice when Insarof dies in his young 
wife's arms. Elena, in a heart-broken letter, bids her parents a last farewell before 
joining the Sisters of Mercy in the Bulgarian army, as she has now no country but 
his. Thus ends the life story of the noblest and most ideal pair of lovers the great 
Russian novelist has ever drawn.</summary>
  <summary author="Auerbach, Berthold (1812-1882)" title="On the Heights: A Novel" print_title="On the Heights:\nA Novel">ON THE HEIGHTS, by Berthold Auerbach (1865), is considered the author's finest work. The charm of the story is not conveyed in a synopsis 
of the plot. Countess Irma von Wildenort has been placed by her father, Count 
Eberhard, a recluse, at a German court. Her beauty and intellectual vivacity 
attract the King, somewhat wearied by his Queen's lofty and pious sentiments and 
her distaste for court festivities. Early in the story the Queen gives birth to the 
Crown Prince, for whom a wet-nurse is found in the person of Walpurga, an upright, 
shrewd peasant woman, who, for the sake of her child's future benefit, reluctantly 
accepts the position. She is full of quaint sayings, and her pious nature finds favor 
with the Queen. Her naive descriptions of court life are very entertaining. From 
the same mountain district as Irma, Walpurga acquires some influence with her, 
and she quickly detects the unspoken love of the King for her; but Irma disregards
her friendly warnings. The Queen is apparently unaware of their increasing infatuation. Irma, becoming restless and unsettled, visits her father, who solemnly 
warns her against the temptations of court life. She is drawn back irresistibly to 
court, and the King reveals his passion for her by kissing the statue of which she is 
the model. Irma, in a sort of ecstasy, submits for a moment to his caresses. 
For a time she lives as though in the clouds. The Queen's friendship for her increases, 
and her Majesty resolutely banishes her occasional suspicions of evil. 

Walpurga returns home laden with gifts and money, and she and her husband, 
Hansei, buy a farm on the mountain. Irma's father meanwhile receives anonymous 
letters, wrongfully representing her as the Kong's mistress. The shock of the accusation mortally prostrates him, and Irma is summoned in haste to his deathbed. 
Unable to speak, he traces one word on her forehead and expires. She falls unconscious. Letters of condolence arrive from their Majesties; the King's inclosure one 
of passionate longing; the Queen's so full of affection and confidence that remorse 
seizes Irma. She writes her guilt to the Queen, and resolves to drown herself. In 
her wanderings she comes unexpectedly on Walpurga and her family, on the way 
to take possession of their new home. She implores protection from herself; and 
in the care of Walpurga and the grandmother, she lives for a year "on the heights," 
writing a journal of philosophical and religious rhapsody. 

Tormented by remorse, she grows weaker in body, while her soul becomes purified of its earthly passion. Gunther, her father's friend, absolves her from his curse; 
and, her spirit freed, she passes away in the presence of the King and Queen, now 
happily reconciled.</summary>

In this charming short story, published in 1867, in a collection of 'Nouvelles,' the 
author shows the exhaustive study which he had made of Egypt and its ancient 
customs. He introduces Cleopatra to his readers as she is being rowed down the 
Nile to her summer palace. In describing the cause of her ennui to Charmian, 
Cleopatra graphically pictured the belittling, crushing effect of the gigantic monuments of her country. She bewails the fate of a Queen who can never know if she 
is loved for herself alone, and longs for some strange adventure. She has been followed down the Nile by Meiamoun, a young man who is violently infatuated with 
the Queen, but whom she has never noticed. That night she is startled by an arrow 
which enters her window bearing a roll of papyrus on which is written, "I love you." 
She looks from the window and sees a man shimming across the Nile, but her servants are unable to find him. Soon after, Meiamoun dives down into the subterranean passage which conducts the waters of the Nile to Cleopatra's bath; and the 
next morning, as she is enjoying her bath, she finds him gazing at her. She condemns him to death, and then pardons him. He begs for death, and she yields, 
but tells him he shall first find his most extravagant dream realized: he shall be 
the lover of Cleopatra. "I take thee from nothingness; I make thee the equal of a 
god, and I replunge thee into nothingness." "It was necessary to make of the life 
of Meiamoun a powerful elixir which he could drain from a single cup." Then 
follows the description of the feast. After a night of magnificent splendor, a cup of 
poison is handed to him. Touched by his beauty and bravery, Cleopatra is about 
to order him not to drink, when the heralds announce the arrival of Mark Antony. 
He asks; "What means this corpse upon the floor?" "Oh! nothing," she answers, 
"a poison I was trying, in order to use it should Augustus make me prisoner. 
Will it please you, my dear, to sit by me and watch the dancers?"</summary>

The family have come from another western city, and Milly, who has social ambitions, 
is much disappointed to find that her father has chosen an unattractive house in 
an unfashionable quarter. Mr. Ridge is a man without culture or polish, who has 
never been successful financially, and is dominated by his pretty and self-willed daughter; the latter, overcoming her disappointment as best she can, sets about gaining 
an entrance into society, and through connecting herself with a certain church, 
makes influential friends, who aid her social career. She becomes engaged to a rich 
man, for whom she does not care, but throws him, over, and later marries Jack Bragdon, a poor young artist, for love. This marriage is regarded as most quixotic by 
her friends, who know her extravagant tastes and love of society. A legacy of $3,000 
left by her grandmother, coming shortly after her marriage, enables Alilly and her 
artist husband to go to Paris, where the latter desires to study. Here, a daughter

housekeeper and companion for a business woman, named Ernestine Geyer, who is 
charmed by her winning personality. Miss Geyer makes a good living out of running a laundry and has kid up $10,000, which, later, Milly persuades her to invest 
in starting a cake-shop with, herself. This proves a financial failure, and at this 
crisis Milly marries an old-time admirer, a rich ranchman, and leaves without a

a soul; the agonies, the sickness unto death, and the recovery, of a noble mind. 
Ernestine von Hartwich, embittered by the fact that she is "only a girl," a shortcoming which has caused her father's hate and mother's death, determines to equal 
a man in achievement, in scientific attainments and in mental usefulness, that 
her sex shall no longer be made to her a reproach and even a crime. This desire is 
taken advantage of by an unscrupulous uncle who will profit by her death. Secluding her from the world, he attempts to undermine her health by feeding her feverish 
ambitions. Her mind is developed at the expense of very human feeling, every 
womanly instinct, and every religious emotion. She is shunned by women, envied 
and humiliated by men, regarded by her servants and the neighboring peasantry as 
a witch. It is through the door of love, opened for her by Johannes Mollner, that 
she finally leaves the wilderness of false aims, unnatural ambitions, and unsatisfactory 
results, to enjoy for the first time the charm of womanhood, human companionship, 
and belief in God. The story is overloaded with didacticism; its logic fails, inasmuch as the poor girl is an involuntary martyr; and its exaggeration and sentimentality do not appeal to the English reader. But the book was a great favorite in 
Germany, where it has been considered a powerful argument against what is called 
the higher education of women. </summary>
  <summary author="Parkman, Francis (1823-1893)" title="The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life" print_title="The Oregon Trail:\nSketches of Prairie\nand Rocky-Mountain Life">OREGON TRAIL, THE, 'Sketches of the Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life,' by 
Francis Parkman, was first published in 1847, in the Knickerbocker Magazine, 
then in book form in 1849 under the title 'The California and Oregon Trail'; in 
later editions the book reverted to its old title. It is a graphic and highly entertaining account of a journey undertaken by Parkman and his friend Quincy Adams 
Shaw, both fresh from college, in the summer of 1846. Already dedicated to the 
task of writing the history of England and France in the New World, Parkman 
wanted experience at first hand of the unsettled wilderness and its aboriginal inhabitants. The friends decided to journey from the Missouri to the foot-hills of the 
Rockies, following the settlers' route to Oregon, which then included the whole 
territory west of the Rockies from Mexico to the fiftieth parallel. Leaving St. Louis 
on April 28th they proceeded by steamer to a point near Kansas City. From here
they set out with a guide, a muleteer, five horses, and three mules. Traveling with 
a party of Englishmen for company and for part of the way with a small troop of 
emigrants, they traversed what is now the state of Kansas and then followed the valley of the Platte. The way was enlivened by heavy windstorms, by the appearance 
of Indians, and by an exciting buffalo hunt. Leaving their companions at the forks 
of the Platte they followed the North Fork, entered what is now the state of Wyoming, and reached Fort Laramie, then a trading-post. Here they remained for several 
days, fraternizing with a village of Sioux Indians encamped near-by. Though 
weakened by serious illness. Parkman determined to join one of the bands of Sioux 
who were planning to take the war-path against the Snake Indians. By a series 
of misunderstandings, they missed the party which they were seeking, but Parkman 
would not agree to turn back, and taking another guide pushed on alone in pursuit, 
promising to meet Shaw and the rest of the party at Fort Laramie on the first of 
August. A ride through a wild and mountainous part of Wyoming, infested by 
hostile Indians, brought Parkman to the band of Sioux, whom he was seeking. They 
were none too trustworthy, and it is probable that only an iron resolution and the 
suppression of all signs of weakness due to a severe illness, preserved Parkman from 
a treacherous assault. He feasted the Indians, was feasted by them in return, 
smoked the peace-pipe with them, made them a set speech, and gave them presents. 
Though he did not see any battles he took part in several buffalo hunts, witnessed 
a serious quarrel which almost came to bloodshed, collected some Indian folk-lore, 
and of course lived intimately with the tribe, sharing their lodges and buffalo robes, 
and getting a valuable insight into their character. He rejoined his party at Fort 
Laramie shortly after August ist, and the return journey was made without incident. Although this journey played its part in undermining his health, it was of 
inestimable value to Parkman as an historian, and was the occasion for one of the 
most delightful books of travel in the language. The picture of the American

  <summary author="Newell, R. H. (Robert Henry) (1836-1901)" title="The Orpheus C. Kerr Papers" print_title="The Orpheus C. Kerr Papers">ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS, THE, by Robert Henry Newell (1862-68). The 
'Letters' composing this book appeared originally in the daily press during the 
Civil War. Xarrating the history of a fictitious and comic "Mackerel Brigade" 
[Mackerel = "Little Mac," McClellan's well-known popular nickname], they 
purported to be written from the scene of action; were devoted to the humors 
of the conflict; and were widely read at the time throughout the North. In a
sense they are historic. Their gibes and bitterly humorous shafts were directed 
chiefly against the dishonest element of society that the upheaval of the war had 
brought to the surface, the cheating contractors, the makers of shoddy clothing, 
imperfect arms, scant-weight ammunition, and bad supplies for the army in the field, 
as well as towards the selfish and incompetent general officers and office-seekers. 
Much of the fun of the letters is to-day unintelligible, some of the satire seems coarse; 
but there is no doubt that the author did immense sen-ice in creating a better sentiment as to the offenses that he scored, and to open the way, among other benefits, 
for the improvement which was to be known as "civil-service reform."</summary>
  <summary author="Chesterton, G. K. (Gilbert Keith) (1874-1936)" title="Orthodoxy" print_title="Orthodoxy">ORTHODOXY, a series of essays by Gilbert K. Chesterton (1908). The book 
presents the positive side of the thought, advanced in 'Heretics,' namely that 
definite convictions and a serious theory of the universe are an essential to sane 
and happy life. In 'Orthodoxy' Chesterton, in response to a challenge, states his 
own philosophy, showing the stages by which he has been led to an acceptance of 
orthodox Christianity. After brilliantly ridiculing the determinists, the sceptics, 
the pragmatists, the worshippers of will, the Tolstoyans, and other modern thinkers because they deprive life of a solid, intelligible purpose and sacrifice wholesome 
sanity to logic, Chesterton outlines the development of his own belief. In 'The 
Ethics of Elfland, ' he derives from the fairy-tales learned in childhood the conviction, 
first, that scientific laws do not establish inevitable connection between phenomena 
and that miracles are conceivable; and, secondly, that incomprehensible happiness 
might depend on an incomprehensible condition, e. g., some apparently irrational 
taboo or formula; in other words, that there is in the universe a personal will in 
distinction to an impersonal law. In 'The Flag of the World* the contradictory 
tendencies of optimism and pessimism are shown to be reconciled by Christianity, 
which, while aflSrming the existence of God and the wickedness of suicide, also 
affirms the separation of the world from God and the glory of martyrdom. The 
author's desire to love the world without trusting it was met by the Christian 
doctrine of the Fall; and this once grasped every other detail seemed to fall into 
place. 'The Paradoxes of Christianity' adduces other examples of conflicting 
tendencies allowed a certain amount of free play by Christianity; for example losing 
one's life and saving it, dignity and humility, mercy and anger, valor and non=resistance, asceticism and marriage; and in this skillful combination the author finds 
a proof of its truth. In 'The Eternal Revolution' Chesterton points out how the 
desire for progress towards a fixed ideal is met by the doctrine of the Fall of Man 
and the scheme of salvation. 'The Romance of Orthodoxy* is an attack on the 
modernist doctrines of the impossibility of miracles (which is a denial of God's 
freedom), the divine immanence (which practically means pantheism), unitarianism 
(which means an Oriental and tyrannical idea of God), universalism (which makes 
moral effort less urgent and the struggle of life less critical), the regarding of sin as 
disease (which destroys free-will), and the denial of the divinity of Christ (which 
derogates from the dignity of suffering). In 'Authority and the Adventurer' Chesterton meets the objection that the moral effects of Christian belief do not prove 
its objective truth by a brief confutation of modern sceptical views and a statement 
of the arguments for the positive truth of Christianity. The negative arguments 
are that men are a superior variety of beasts, that religion arose from fear, and that 
it promotes gloom; that Christianity inculcates weakness, is a product of the dark 
ages, and promotes suspicion and unprogressiveness. After vigorously confuting 
these arguments, Chesterton gives as the positive arguments which appeal to him
that by reliable human testimony miracles do happen, that Christian dogma 
satisfies the instincts of our nature, and that however dissatisfied we may be with 
the imperfections of life, Christianity teaches us to enjoy life as a whole. The 
book irritates many readers by its constant striving after paradox and epigram, 
but its defense of orthodoxy and conservatism is a strong and apparently a 
sincere one.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Othello" print_title="Othello">OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE (written about 1604), ranks with 'Hamlet,' 'Lear,' and 'Macbeth,' as one of Shakespeare's four great masterpieces of 
tragedy. The bare outline of the story came to him from Cinthio's 'II Moro di 
Venezia.' It is the story of "one who loved not wisely, but too well; of one not 
easily jealous, but being wrought, perplexed in the extreme." Othello has a rich 
exotic nature, a heroic tenderness, quick sense of honor, child-like trust, yet fiercest 
passion when wronged in his soul. In lago we have a villain to whom goodness 
is sheer silliness and cruel craft a fine prudence. The Moor has wedded Desdemona, 
and from Venice sailed to Cyprus, followed by Roderigo, who is in love with her and 
is a tool of lago. lago hates Othello for appointing Cassio his lieutenant, leaving 
him to be his humble standard-bearer. He also suspects him of having cuckolded 
him, and for mere suspicion in that land will diet his revenge by trying to pay him 
off wife for wife, or failing that, to poison his happiness forever by jealousy. And 
he wants Cassio 's place. He persuades Roderigo that Cassio and Desdemona are 
in love, and that if he is to prosper, Cassio must be degraded from office or killed. 
The loyal Cassio has a poor brain for drink, lago gets him tipsy and involved in a 
fray, and then has the garrison alarmed by the bell. Othello dismisses Cassio from 
office. The poor man, smitten with deep shame and despair, is advised by "honest" 
lago to seek the mediation of the divine Desdemona, and out of this he will work 
his ruin; for he craftily instills into the mind of Othello that his wife intercedes for 
Cassio as for a paramour, and brings him where he sees Cassio making his suit to her, 
but retiring when he perceives Othello in the distance. "Ha! I like not that," 
says lago. And then, forced to disclose his thought, he reminds the Moor that 
Desdemona deceived her father by her secret marriage, and may deceive him; also 
tells a diabolically false tale of his sleeping with Cassio, and how he talked in his 
sleep about his amour with Desdemona. Othello had given his wife a talismanic 
embroidered handkerchief, sewed by a sibyl in her prophetic fury. lago had often 
urged his wife Emilia to steal this "napkin," and when he gets it he drops it in Cassio's 
chamber. The Moor sees it in his lieutenant's hands, and further sees him laughing 
and gesturing about Bianca, a common strumpet, and is told by lago that Desdemona and his adventures with her were Cassio's theme. When, finally, the "honest," 
"trusty" lago tells him that Cassio had confessed all to him, the tortured man 
throws his last doubt to the winds, and resolves on the death of Cassio and Desdemona both. Cassio is only wounded; but the gentle Desdemona, who, all heart-broken, and foreboding, has retired, is awaked by Othello's last kisses (for his love 
is not wholly quenched), and after a terrible talk, is smothered by him where she 
lies, reviving for a moment, after the entrance of Emilia, to assert that Othello 
is innocent and that she killed herself. The Moor avows the deed, however, both 
to Emilia and to two Venetian officials, who have just arrived on State business. In 
the conversation lago's villainy comes to light through Emilia's telling the truth 
about the handkerchief; she is stabbed to death by lago, while Othello in bitter 
remorse stabs himself, and as he dies imprints a convulsive kiss on the cold lips of 
Desdemona. lago is led away to torture and death.</summary>
  <summary author="Dickens, Charles (1812-1870)" title="Our Mutual Friend" print_title="Our Mutual Friend">OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, by Charles Dickens. "In these times of ours," are 
the opening words of this book, which was published in England in 1864-65. 
The scene is laid in London and its immediate neighborhood. All the elaborate 
machinery dear to Dickens's heart is here introduced. There is the central story of Our 
Mutual Friend, himself the young heir to the vast Harmon estate, who buries his 
identity and assumes the name of John Rokesmith, that he may form his own judgment of the young woman whom he must marry in order to claim his fortune; there 
is the other story of the poor bargeman's daughter, and her love for reckless 
Eugene Wrayburn, the idol of society; and uniting these two threads is the history 
of Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, the ignorant, kind-hearted couple, whose innocent ambitions, and benevolent use of the money intrusted to their care, afford the author 
opportunity for the humor and pathos of which he was a master. 

Among the characters which this story has made famous are Miss Jenny Wren, 
the doll's dressmaker, a little, crippled creature whose love for Lizzie Hexam transforms her miserable life; Bradley Headstone, the schoolmaster, suffering torments 
because of his jealousy of Eugene Wrayburn, and helpless under the careless contempt of that trained adversary -dying at last in an agony of defeat at his failure 
to kill Eugene; and the triumph of Lizzie's love over the social difference between 
her and her lover; Bella Wilfer, "the boofer lady," cured of her longing for riches 
and made John Harmon's happy wife by the plots and plans of the Golden Dustman, 
Mr. Boffin; and Silas Wegg, an impudent scoundrel employed by Mr. Boffen, 
who is, at first, delighted with the services of "a literary man with a wooden leg," 
but who gradually recognizes the cheat and impostor, and unmasks him in dramatic 
fashion. 

As usual, Dickens finds occasion to incite his readers to practical benevolence. 
In this book he has a protest against the poor-laws in the person of old Betty Higden, whose dread of the almshouse haunts her dying hours. By many, this volume, 
published among his later works, is counted as among the most important. </summary>
  <summary author="Hawthorne, Nathaniel (1804-1864)" title="Our Old Home: A Series of English Sketches" print_title="Our Old Home:\nA Series of\nEnglish Sketches">OUR OLD HOME, a series of English sketches by Nathaniel Hawthorne. This 
volume of charming sketches was published in 1863, and (in the words of the author) 
presents "a few of the external aspects of English scenery and life, especially those 
that are touched with the antique charm to which our countrymen are more susceptible than are the people among whom it is of native growth." The opening sketch on 
'Consular Experiences' gives interesting glimpses of Hawthorne's own life as consul 
at Liverpool; and among other entertaining chapters are those designated 'About 
Warwick,' 'Pilgrimage to Old Boston,' 'Some of the Haunts of Burns,' 'Up the 
Thames,' and 'Outside Glimpses of English Poverty.' In that entitled 'Recollections of a Gifted Woman,' he recounts his acquaintance with Miss Delia Bacon, who 
was then deep in her 'Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare'; an absurd book, for 
which Hawthorne wrote a humorous preface. These, and other English sketches 
included in Hawthorne's note-books, were at first intended by him to be used as a 
background for a work of fiction which he had partially planned; but what he calls 
"the Present, the Immediate, the Actual, " proved too potent for him, and the project 
was given up and only the sketches were published. This volume holds its popularity 
not simply because of the incomparable charm of the manner in which it is written, 
but because of its faithful delineation of nature, life, and manners in England. 
There are clues to English character to be gathered from 'Our Old Home,' which 
could not otherwise be obtained save by protracted association with the English 
people at home.</summary>
  <summary author="Mitford, Mary Russell (1787-1855)" title="Our Village" print_title="Our Village">OUR VILLAGE, by Alary Russell Mitford, was one of the first books written which 
show the poetry of every-day life in the country; and Miss Mitford may fairly be 
called the founder of the school of village literature. There is no connected story, 
but the book contains a series of charming sketches of country scenes and country 
people. The chronicler wanders through the lanes and meadows with her white 
greyhound Mayflower, gossips about the trees, the flowers, and the sunsets, and 
describes the beauty of English scenery. The chapters on The First Primrose, 
Violeting, The Copse, The Wood, The Dell, and The Cowslip Ball, seem to breathe 
the very atmosphere of spring; while others tell interesting stories about the people 
and village life. In her walks, the saunterer is accompanied by Lizzy, the carpenter's 
daughter, a fascinating baby of three, who trudges by her side, and is a very entertaining companion. Descriptions of the country are dwelt on more frequently than
descriptions of the people, but there is a capital sketch of Hannah Bint, who 
showed great judgment in setting up as a dairy- woman when only twelve years old, 
besides various short discourses on schoolboys, fanners, and the trades-people of the 
town. The scenes are laid in "shady yet sunny Berkshire, where the scenery, without 
rising into grandeur or breaking into wildness, is so peaceful, so cheerful, so varied, 
and so thoroughly English." The first series of sketches in 'Our Village' appeared in 
1824.</summary>
  <summary author="Lanciani, Rodolfo Amedeo (1847-1929)" title="Pagan and Christian Rome" print_title="Pagan and Christian Rome">PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN ROME, by Rudolfo Lanciani (1893). A most richly 
illustrated account of the changes at Rome, by which it was gradually transformed 
from a pagan to a Christian city. Discoveries recently made show that Christian 
teaching reached the higher classes at a very early date, and even penetrated to the 
palace of the Caesars. Long before the time at which Rome is supposed to have 
favored Christianity, there had been built churches side by side with the temples of 
the old faith. Tombs also bear the same testimony to gains made by Christianity in 
important quarters. Great names in the annals of the empire are found to be those 
of members of the Christian body. The change in fact which was brought to maturity under Constantine was not a sudden and unexpected event. It was not a revolution. It had been a foregone conclusion for several generations, the natural result of 
progress during nearly three centuries. It had come to be understood before the 
official recognition of it by Constantine. A great deal that was a continuance of 
things pagan in appearance had in fact received Christian recognition and been 
turned to Christian use. Institutions and customs which still exist originated under 
the old faith, and were brought into the sen-ice of the new. Far more than has beer 
supposed, the change was due to tolerance between pagans and Christians. By 
comparing pagan shrines and temples with Christian churches, imperial tombs with
papal tombs, and pagan cemeteries with Christian, Lanciani at once discloses the 
wealth of art created in Rome, and proves that pagan and Christian were allied in its 
creation.</summary>
  <summary author="Carlyle, Thomas (1795-1881)" title="Past and Present" print_title="Past and Present">PAST AND PRESENT, by Thomas Carlyle. This treatise was published in England 
in April, 1843; in May it was published in America, prefaced by an appealing notice 
to publishers, written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, to the effect that the book was 
printed from a manuscript copy sent by the author to his friends, and was published 
for the benefit of the author. Mr. Emerson somewhat optimistically hoped that this 
fact would "incline publishers to respect Mr. Carlyle's property in his own book." 

'Past and Present' was written in seven weeks, as a respite from the harassing 
labor of writing 'Cromwell.' In 1842, the Camden Society had published the 
'Chronicles of the Abbey of St. Edmund's Bury,' written by Joceline de Brakelonde, 
at the close of the twelfth century. This account of a mediaeval monastery had 
taken Carlyle's fancy; and in 'Past and Present' he contrasted the England of his 
own day with the England of Joceline de Brakelonde. Englishmen of his own day 
he divided into three classes: the laborers, the devotees of Mammon, and the disciples of dilettanteism. Between these three classes, he said, there was no tie of 
human brotherhood. In the old da}^ the noble was the man who fought for the 
safety of society. For the dilettantes and the Mammonites he preached the " Gospel 
of Work. " For the uplifting of the class of laborers, for the strengthening of the tie 
of human brotherhood, he proposed what seemed chimerical schemes in 1843; but 
before his death some of his schemes had been realized. He attacked the "laissez 
faire" principle most fiercely; he advocated legislative interference in labor, sanitary 
and educational legislation, an organized emigration service, some system of profit-sharing, and the organization of labor. 

In 1843, 'Past and Present' was regarded as forceful, rousing, but not practical. 
It had, however, a great effect on the young and enthusiastic; and is now looked on as 
one of the best of Carlyle's books, and as the expression of a political philosophy 
which, however violently expressed, was at bottom sensible and practical.</summary>

of a trilogy introducing the Maironi family, Franco and Luisa, the father and mother 
of Piero Maironi, who is the "Sinner" in 'Piccolo mondo moderno,' and becomes the 
"Saint" in 'Il Santo.' The scene of 'The Patriot' is Valsolda on the beautiful Lake 
Lugano, during the years of Austrian oppression preceding United Italy. The 
story is the conflict between the religious nature of Franco and the scepticism of his 
wife, Luisa, which later accounts for the warring elements in the temperament of their 
son. Franco is cast out by his wicked old grandmother, the Marchesa Maironi, 
because he will marry the lovely Luisa, who, as the daughter of a teacher, is not his 
equal in rank or fortune. His strength is blind faith in the religion and practice of 
the Catholic Church. On the eve of his departure to Piedmont to join the patriots, 
Luisa confesses to him her rationalist beliefs. Their devoted love for each other does 
not fail but they are separated in spirit by their different views of life. They have 
one child, Maria, whom they adore. The child is drowned, and Luisa's grief almost 
destroys her reason. Franco returns too late to see his child, and is nearly captured 
by Austrian spies. As the war for freedom begins, Luisa is persuaded to leave the 
grave of her child to say goodbye to her husband. The vision of war and death to 
come brings her to herself, and the child is conceived who is to fight the battle of 
the modern world. </summary>
  <summary author="Saint-Pierre, Bernardin de (1737-1814)" title="Paul and Virginia" print_title="Paul and Virginia">PAUL AND VIRGINIA, a novel by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, was published in 1788. 
The scene is Port Saint Louis in Isle de France, now Mauritius, and the story is 
narrated to a visitor by one of the colonists, a friend of the persons concerned. In a 
beautiful wooded valley lived two women, each with her child and servant, and each 
in her own cottage, but cultivating the land jointly and living on terms of the closest 
intimacy. One of these women was Madame de la Tour, a widow disowned by her 
noble family in France for marrying beneath her. She had a daughter, Virginia, born 
after the death of her husband, and a negro slave-woman, Marie, married to the 
negro, Domingo, the farm laborer of the two properties and the slave of Marguerite, 
the owner of the other cottage. Marguerite is a Breton peasant girl betrayed by her 
lover, and has sought refuge from slander in this distant colony. Her child, Paul, 
completes this little circle, which lives in idyllic peace and content. Strongly influenced by Rousseau's 'Emile,' the author paints an existence of ideal simplicity, 
in which the elders support themselves by wholesome labor and the children grow up 
in innocent, healthy activity, ignorant of books, but skilled in useful arts, in knowledge 
of the external world, in admiration for the gorgeous scenery of the island, and in an 
atmosphere of natural piety and affection. The domestic scenes, and the episode 
of the children's wandering through the forest on a humanitarian errand and losing 
their way, are prettily narrated. Rousseau's 'Nouvelle Heloise' furnishes the suggestion for the scenes of passion and renunciation which follow and for the emotional 
and pictorial descriptions of nature with which they are surrounded. As the children 
grow up they begin to feel an affection for one another different from the brotherly 
and sisterly feeling of their earlier years. The mothers notice this and discuss their
marriage, which Madame de la Tour would defer until the children are older. 
now comes from France that Madame de la Tour's aunt, to whom she had formerly 
applied in vain for assistance, is willing to forgive her and to make Virginia her heir. 
At the urgent advice of the governor of the island M. de la Bourdonnais and of her 
confessor Mme. de la Tour accepts the offer, and after declaring her love for Paul 
and promising to be his wife, Virginia sails for France. In a year and a half she writes 
that her aunt has sent her to a convent to be educated and keeps her under severe 
restrictions. More than two years later a French ship is sighted and a message comes 
in the pilot's boat from Virginia that she has been disinherited by her aunt for refusing 
a marriage arranged for her and is now on board the ship and immediately to return 
to her mother and Paul. But a hurricane wrecks the ship before it can land, and 
Virginia, refusing to remove her clothes or accept the aid of a naked sailor who offers 
to take her to shore, is washed overboard and drowned. In attempting to swim out 
'to her, Paul is hurled back upon the beach, wounded and senseless. He recovers, but 
all efforts to comfort him are vain; and two months after the death of Virginia he 
himself dies of grief, soon followed by his mother, and by Virginia's. The death of 
the old negro couple leaves only the aged settler, who tells the story and who was the 
intimate friend of both families, to keep alive their memory. For the modern reader 
the book is spoiled by a tendency to sentimentality, an absence of realism, a reliance 
on theatrical effects, an excessive penchant for moralizing, and the prudery of the 
motive responsible for Virginia's death. There is nevertheless a simple attractiveness about the youthful figures, set off by the romantic beauty of the tropical scenery 
and the passionate intensity of their love.</summary>

truthful and interesting picture of the people in a Maine fishing hamlet. Mara 
Lincoln, the "Pearl," a beautiful girl, has been brought up by her grandparents, 
Captain and Mrs. Pennel; her father having been drowned and her mother having 
died at her birth. Moses, the hero of the book, shipwrecked and washed ashore upon 
the island when very young, is brought up and cared for by the Pennels; and bears 
their name. The result of this is the mutual attachment of the young people, which 
is at first more strongly felt by Mara. Moses accepts Mara's devotion as a matter of 
course, and does not awaken to the fact that he is in love with her until piqued by the 
attentions bestowed upon her by Mr. Adams of Boston. Then, prompted by jealousy, 
he pays marked attention to Sally Zittridge, a bright and attractive girl, Mara's 
dearest friend; but Sally, always loyal to Mara, makes Moses realize the true state 
of his feelings. 

The descriptions of the picturesque scenery of the island are graphic and accurate; 
and the Pennel house, now known as the "Pearl house," and the "grotto," where 
Moses and Sally are shut in by the tide, are objects of interest to visitors. The spicy 
sea-yarns of Captain Kittridge, and the quaint sayings of Miss Roxy and Miss Ruey 
Toothacre are entertaining features of the book. 'The Pearl of Orr's Island' was 
not published until 1862, although it was begun ten years before that time. </summary>

Garden, where the Irish actress, Margaret TVoffington, in the hey-day of her fame 
and beauty, tricks the entire dramatic company, including Colley Gibber the famous 
playwright and comedian, by personating the great tragic actress Mrs. Bracegirdle. 
At the same time she achieves the conquest of a wealthy and accomplished Shropshire

Pomander. Vane besieges her with flowers and verses until he arouses the jealousy 
of Sir Charles, who is also her admirer. In the midst of a banquet which Mr. Vane 
is giving in honor of the actress, his lovely country bride appears unexpectedly upon 
the scene. Peg WofBngton, who had believed Vane to be a single man and her loyal 
suitor, hides her grief and resentment under a guise of mockery; but the innocent young 
wife faints away on finding out how she has been betrayed. Peg Woffington next 
appears in the garret of a poor scrub author and scene-painter, James Triplet, whom 
she has befriended by sitting to him for her portrait. Here, after fooling a party of 
her theatrical comrades and would-be art critics, who have come to abuse the picture, 
by the ingenious device of cutting out the painted face and inserting her own in the 
aperture, she practices the same trick upon Mabel Vane, Ernest's wife, who has sought 
refuge with Triplet from the persecutions of Sir Charles Pomander. Mabel, seeing 
the image of her rival, pours forth to it a pathetic appeal that Peg will not rob her 
of her only treasure, her husband's heart; when to her dismay, she perceives a tear 
upon the portrait's face, which reveals the real woman: and a touching interview 
follows, in which the courted actress begs the simple young wife to be her friend. 
Then comes on the scene Sir Charles Pomander, in amorous pursuit of Mabel; closely 
followed by her husband, whom Triplet has summoned to the rescue. A reconciliation between the married pair results, and Sir Charles retires discomfited. Woffington 
takes an affectionate leave of the Vanes, who soon return to their Shropshire home 
and domestic bliss; while the noble-hearted Peg, after a few years more of stage 
triumphs, retires before her bloom has faded, to a life in the country, and there ends 
her days, "the Bible in her hand, the Cross in her heart; quiet; amidst grass and 
flowers, and charitable deeds." </summary>

May 31st, 1669, by Samuel Pepys, clerk of the Navy Board. The manuscript was 
left with the rest of his library to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where it was 
deciphered by the Reverend John Smith between 1819 and 1822. The first edition, 
edited by Lord Braybrooke, appeared in 1825; fuller editions were published in 1828, 
1848-1849, 1854, and 1875-9; tne standard edition by H. B. Wheatley in 1893-1899. 
Pepys was the son of a London tailor, and a student of St. Paul's School and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was married early to the daughter of a Huguenot 
refugee. Through his cousin, Edward Montagu, afterwards Earl of Sandwich, he 
was a passenger on the ship that brought Charles II. home from exile, obtained his 
clerkship in the Navy Office and gained access to the Restoration court. During 
the nine years in which he kept his diary he was a busy and valued public servant 
steadily increasing in wealth and prosperity. His diary is an intimate record of his 
daily business, recreations, personal likes and dislikes, and domestic affairs. Its 
accounts of the various political and social changes of the Restoration, of the intrigues 
and corruption of the English Navy in the days of the Dutch war, of the great plague 
and fire of London, and of the social habits and customs of the people, especially
the middle and upper classes are of the highest value to historians. Pepys was one of 
those sociable people who are never weary of attending functions of all kinds, and 
whose zest for life renders nothing human uninteresting to them. Thus the mere

Again, he was writing for no eye but his own and consequently set down with absolute 
frankness instances of his own foolishness, selfishness, cruelty, and sensuality, which 
most men would carefully conceal even from themselves. Pepys was, however, no 
villain. He was a respectable London householder, an able official, respected by his 
colleagues, a lover of music and an antiquarian, a collector of old ballads; but there 
was a streak of coarseness in him, though no more than we should expect in an 
"homme moyen sensuel " of the Restoration period. He took bribes, ate and drank 
too much, admired the dissolute ladies at the court, flirted with pretty girls, was cruel 
to his servants, and jealous of his wife, though unfaithful to her, and did not observe 
consistency between his religious moods and his practice. The frankness, nawete, 
and unconscious humour with which he sets down these sins and peccadilloes has 
a strange fascination for the reader. Of course part of the piquancy of the book 
comes from the fact that the reader is overhearing something which the writer never 
intended him to know. The diary was kept up for nine years, when the weakness of 
Pepys's eyes forced him to relinquish it. Had it never been discovered he would still 
have been remembered as an antiquarian and historian of the Navy, but one of the 
most interesting and spontaneous revelations of a personality in all literature would 
have been lost.</summary>

that the master of French fiction ever forced upon a fascinated but reluctant reader. 
It is the history of a modern Lear. Pere Goriot, a retired manufacturer of vermicelli, 
having married his daughters, Anastasie to the Count de Restaud, and Delphine to 
che Baron de Nucingen, is abandoned by them after he has settled on them his whole 
fortune. Even to see them he is reduced to the extremity of watching on the street to 
get a glimpse of their beloved faces as they drive by. In the wretched pension where 
he lives he meets Eugene de Rastinac, whose distant relationship to the Viscountess 
de Beause"ant enables him to frequent the select society of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. He there makes the acquaintance of Pere Goriot's daughters, and becomes 
the cavalier of Delphine. The daughters, mere devotees of fashion, treat the poor 
old man with increasing barbarity, until, knowing that he is on his death-bed, they 
both attend a ball, though he beseeches them to come to him. He is buried by 
charitable acquaintances; and as the body is brought from the church, the empty 
coaches of the daughters fall in behind and follow it to the grave. Crowded with 
incidents, and made profoundly interesting by its merciless fidelity of characterization 'Pere Goriot' compels attention; while in style it is one of the most brilliant of 
Balzac's long succession of novels.</summary>

  <summary author="Croly, Herbert David (1869-1930)" title="The Promise of American Life" print_title="The Promise\nof American Life">PROMISE OF AMERICAN LIFE, THE, 'a treatise on social and political science' 
by Herbert Croly (1909). He begins by analyzing the conception of America as 
the land of promise and distinguishing between the uncritical anticipation of continued prosperity and the responsible effort to ensure the fulfilment of this hope 
by the attempt to realize an ideal. Many Americans do not make this distinction; 
and those who make it do not all recognize that a change of conditions has made 
necessary a revision of the American ideal. The original ideal was one of political 
and economic freedom and independence, rinding expression in universal competition; 
and its effects were good since it was a stimulus to activity and exploitation of the 
sources of wealth; but with the increase of population and the seizure of natural 
resources into a few hands has come a "morally and unsociably undesirable distribution of wealth." This must be regulated by the state, if the "promise of American 
life" is to remain valid for the masses; and thus the old untrammeled individual freedom must give way to social control. These opinions are enforced by a review of 
American political and economic history, outlining the struggles of Federalists and 
Republicans, Whigs and Democrats, Slavery men and Abolitionists, and after 1870, 
the growth of specialized scientific political, commercial, and business interests, 
which destroyed the homogeneity of American life and brought about the need of a 
renewed solidarity. Four typical reformers, Bryan, Jerome, Hearst, and Roosevelt, 
are then subjected to analysis and criticism. The author now gives his own proposals 
for reform. Democracy must be interpreted not merely as the securing of equal 
rights for all but as the insuring of well-being and social improvement to the various 
types of individuals who constitute the state. The capitalists and the masses must 
be so regulated as to insure the economic and social improvement of all, without 
doing violence to the principle of private property or of nationality. Particular 
problems of international policy and administrative and industrial reform are then 
considered, and the book closes with a discussion of what the individual can do to 
insure the success of the public measures proposed. The book is a carefully reasoned 
presentation of the altered political and social theories made necessary by the advent 
of a new era in the history of America.</summary>
  <summary author="Antin, Mary (1881-1949)" title="The Promised Land" print_title="The Promised Land">PROMISED LAND, THE, by Mary Antin (1912). This is an autobiographical 
study of the immigrant, of what he brings to America, and what he finds here, and 
in it the author presents the case of the Russian Jew's American citizenship in a new 
and vivid light. The book opens with the child's early life in Polotzk, where the 
Jews are enduring many persecutions and where they are forced to live within the 
"Pale" set apart for them. Thus shut out from the national existence they had 
retained many quaint and mediaeval customs and curious religious ceremonies described by the little Jewish girl, who at an early age began to pen this story of her life. 
When the writer was but ten years old her father emigrated to America, later sending 
for his family to join him in the new world. The writer gives a touching description 
of the uncomfortable exodus from the old world and their adventures on the way to 
their new home in the north end of Boston. Here the advantages of the "Promised 
Land" awaken wonder and delight and the child begins at once to profit by the free 
education which may be enjoyed by all. Her story contains many pictures of the 
problems and perplexities faced by this Jewish family in their endeavors to assimilate 
themselves with the life of their adopted country. While seeing life from the slums 
of the city the writer sets forth her gradual advance towards taking possession of all 
the heritage offered in this new land. Passing with honors through the public-schools, 
aided by sympathetic teachers, and by the clubs and settlement-homes open to her, 
the young girl develops into the thoughtful and cultured woman, who shows in this 
story of her own development the possibilities open to all the aliens who come with
the earnest intention of profiting by the advantages which all may share alike in this 
land of the free. Having traced the story of the child through her school-days and 
watched her gradually expand under the influence of teachers, friends, free libraries 
and lecture halls the reader takes leave of her as she is about to enter the college gates 
which have just opened to admit this pilgrim who has learned to grasp all the best 
treasures offered in the "Promised Land."</summary>

a set of fantastic tales, juvenile in character. Two children Dan and Una amuse 
themselves by enacting portions of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' which they do 
on Midsummer Eve, in the middle of a Fairy Ring, on Pook's Hill in old England. 
Suddenly Puck appears beside them and after instructing them in fairy lore joins 
them in a series of adventures. In the successive chapters which are pervaded by 
historic personages as well by the influences of the fairies and People of the Hills, the 
reader is introduced to the most important epochs in the development of England's 
history; the children are instructed by Puck regarding the heroes of Asgard and 
various other traditional happenings and in their sylvan exploits in his company they 
constantly encounter the famous personages under discussion. They learn of the 
adventures of King Philip's fleet as they tramp through the pastures through which 
the great guns were once carried to the sea-coast. As they fish in the brook, they are 
instructed regarding the "Domesday Book" and the ownership of the land where 
they rest under the trees. The woods speak to them of the doings of the Saxons and 
with nimble Puck at their side they follow the footsteps of those early warriors; they 
note where the Northmen fled, and where Alfred's ships came by. King John and his 
Magna Charta is introduced to them and Roman Legions appear before them, under 
the guidance of Caesar. King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table flit before 
their curious gaze and when in the final chapter Una and Dan take leave of Puck, 
they have learned from their fantastic guide the substance of all the vital events 
which have played the principal part in their country's development and have been 
impressed with the spirit of true patriotism. Each chapter is prefaced by a song, 
lyric, or ballad, in keeping with the character of the text which is to follow, as for 
example 'The Runes on Weland's Sword,' 'A British-Roman Song,' 'A Pict 
Song, ' 'A Smuggler's Song,' and others of varying theme.</summary>
  <summary author="Reade, Charles (1814-1884)" title="Put Yourself in His Place" print_title="Put Yourself\nin His Place">PUT YOURSELF IN HIS PLACE, by Charles Reade (1870) is a dramatic novel with 
a purpose. The scene is laid in Hillsborough, an English manufacturing city; and 
the story relates the struggles of Henry Little, workman and inventor, against the 
jealousy and prejudice of the trades-unions. Because he is a Londoner, because he is 
better trained and consequently better paid than the Hillsborough men, because he 
invents quicker processes and labor-saving devices, he is subjected to a series of 
persecutions worthy of the Dark Ages, and is ground between the two millstones of 
Capital and Labor; for if the workmen are ferocious and relentless, they have
learned their villainy from the masters and bettered the instruction. This stern 
study of social problems, however, is nowhere a tract, but always the story of Henry 
Little, who is as devoted a lover as he is honest a workman, as thorough a social 
reformer as a clear, practical thinker, and the hero of as bitter a fight against prejudice, worldly ambition, and unscrupulous rivalry outside the mills, as that which he 
wages against "The Trades." Among the notable figures in the book are Squire 
Raby, Henry's uncle, a gentleman of the old school; Jael Dence, the country girl, 
simple, honest, and strong; Grotait, the gentlemanly president of the Saw-Grinders' 
Union, with his suave manners and his nickname of " Old Smitem "; and Dr. Amboyne 
philanthropist and peacemaker, who maintains thai* to get on with anybody you must 
understand him, and when you understand him you will get on with him. His 
favorite motto is the title of the book. Like all of Charles Reade's stories, 'Put 
Yourself in His Place' has a wealth of dramatic incident, and moves with dash and 
vigor.</summary>

human being, who develop es his muscles and falls in love with a charming girl named 
Sharlee Wayland. At the opening of the story Mr. Queed has a humiliating encounter with Miss Wayland's big dog who knocks him down on a crowded thoroughfare and kindles his indignation. Later he encounters Miss Wayland at her aunt's
boarding-house where he is living and toiling day and night over a monumental work 
on Sociology. Miss Wayland becomes gradually interested in Mr. Queed as an 
intellectual curiosity, who is sadly in need of humanizing influences as well as remunerative labor; she secures him a position on a daily paper where he exercises his 
intellectual powers effectively but where he discovers that he is physically a weakling, 
when he is attacked by an irate proof-reader. From this time Mr. Queed sets out to 
develop his muscles and consorts with a pugilistic friend named Klinker, who introduces him to athletic circles. By degrees the life around him begins more and more 
to reach him, first at one point and then at another, until in the course of turn, he 
develops a normal and rounded manhood. The mystery which has surrounded his 
birth is in the end cleared up, and he discovers that he is the son and heir of Henry G. 
Surface, whom he had known under the name of Professor Xiclovius. The chance 
discovery of a letter bearing the name of Surface reveals the Professor's identity, and 
the young man confronts him with the fact and he confesses that he is the hated and 
despised being who has won a dishonorable notoriety in years past, and who has 
betrayed the friendship of Miss Wayland's father and looted her own fortune so that 
she is forced to earn her living. Not until after the death of the supposed Professor 
does Queed learn that he is in reality Henry G. Surface, Jr. This discovery causes 
him to at once set about righting the wrong done by his father. He turns over his 
estate to Miss Wayland who promptly refuses it, though she shows her partiality for 
its owner. In the end a compromise is arranged and she accepts the money with the 
understanding that she shall use it to endow a Reformatory which she calls the Henry

  <summary author="Scott, Walter (1771-1832)" title="Quentin Durward" print_title="Quentin Durward">QUENTIN DURWARD, by Sir Walter Scott (1823). The scene of this exciting 
story is France during the reign of Louis XL, and its main outline is this: Quentin 
Durward, a brave young Scot, having a relative in the Scottish Guards of the French 
king, comes to France to seek his fortune. The crafty and superstitious Louis is 
pleased with the youth, and sends him on a strange errand. Under the royal protection are two vassals of the Duke of Burgundy, the lovely Isabelle of Croye and her 
scheming aunt. Charles of Burgundy is too formidable an enemy, and Louis decides 
to make Isabelle the wife of William de la Marck, a notorious brigand, who is quite 
able to defend his bride. The unsuspecting Quentin is sent to conduct the ladies to 
the Bishop of Liege, the plan being that William shall attack the party and cany off 
his prize. Quentin, discovering the king's treachery, succeeds in delivering his 
charge to the bishop; but even here she is not safe. William attacks the castle of 
Liege and murders the bishop, while Quentin and Isabelle escape. She returns to 
Burgundy, preferring her old persecutor to the perfidious king. But that wily 
monarch has already joined forces with the bold duke, to avenge the bishop's death 
and to besiege De la Marck. Charles offers the hand of Isabelle as a prize to the 
conqueror of William, and Quentin bears off in triumph a not unwilling bride. 

Among the chief characters introduced are the Burgundian herald, the Count of 
Crevecceur, and Le Balafre of the Scottish Guard, Quentin's uncle. The figure of 
Louis is well drawn in his superstitions, his idolatry of the leaden images that garnished his hat-band, in his political intriguing, and in his faithlessness and lack of 
honor. The book made a sensation in France, and its first success was on foreign 
shores. It was written at the flood-tide of Scott's popularity at home; the ebb began 
with 'St. Ronan's Well,' published six months later. The principal anachronisms 
are noted in the later editions. </summary>
  <summary author="Sienkiewicz, Henryk (1846-1916)" title="Quo Vadis" print_title="Quo Vadis">QUO VADIS (1895) perhaps the most popular novel of the Polish master in fiction, 
Henryk Sienkiewicz, is, like the "trilogy," historical; it deals, however, not with the 
history of Poland, but with that of Rome in the time of Nero. The magnificent 
spectacular environment of the decaying Roman empire, the dramatic qualities of 
the Christian religion, then assuming a world-wide significance, offer rich material 
for the genius of Sienkiewicz. He presents the background of his narrative with 
marvelous vividness. Against it he draws great figures: Petronius, the lordly Roman 
noble the very flower of paganism; Eunice and Lygia, diverse products of the same 
opulent world; Nero, the beast-emperor; the Christians seeking an unseen kingdom 
in a city overwhelmed by the symbols of earthly imperialism; and many others 
typical of dying Rome, or of that new Rome to be established on the ruined throne 
of the Caesars. The novel as a whole is intensely dramatic, sometimes melodramatic. 
Its curious title has reference to an ancient legend, which relates that St. Peter, 
fleeing from Rome and from crucifixion, meets his Lord Christ on the Appian Way. 
"Lord, whither goest thou?" (Domine, quo vadis?) cries Peter. "To Rome, to be 
crucified again," is the reply. The apostle thereupon turns back to his martyrdom. 
While 'Quo Vadis' cannot rank with the "trilogy," it is in many respects a remarkable novel.</summary>

dewlaps shaking as he goes." His friends are his master and mistress, James Noble,

although not printed until 1556, and probably written about 1541. At this time 
Nicholas Udall, its author, was headmaster of Eton school; and the comedy was 
written for the schoolboys, whose custom it was to act a Latin play at the Christmas 
season. An English play was an innovation, but 'Ralph Roister Doister' was very 
successful; and though Nicholas Udall rose in the Church, reaching the dignity of 
canon of Windsor, he is chiefly remembered as the author of this comedy. 

Roisterer is an old word for swaggerer or boaster; and the hero of this little five-act comedy is a good-natured fellow, fond of boasting of his achievements, especially 
what he has accomplished or might accomplish in love. The play concerns itself 
with his rather impertinent suit to Dame Christian Custance, "a widow with a 
thousand pound," who is already the betrothed of Gavin Goodluck. But as Gavin, 
a thrifty merchant, is away at sea, Ralph Roister Doister sees no reason why he 
should not try his luck. His confidant is Matthew Merrygreek, a needy humorist, 
who undertakes to be a go-between and gain the widow's good-will for Ralph. He 
tries to get some influence over the servants of Custance; and there is a witty scene 
with the three maids, Madge Mumblecrust, Tibet Talkapace, and Annot Allface. 
The sen-ants of Ralph Harpax and Dobinet Doughty have a considerable 
part in the play, and the latter complains rather bitterly that he has to run about so 
much in the interest of his master's flirtations. 

Dame Custance, though surprised at the presumption of Ralph and his friend, 
at length consents to read a letter which he has sent her, or rather to have it read to 
her by Matthew Merrygreek. The latter, by mischievously altering the punctuation, makes the letter seem the reverse of what had been intended. Ralph is ready to 
kill the scrivener who had indited the letter for him, until the poor man, by reading it 
aloud himself, proves his integrity. While Dame distance has no intention of 
accepting Ralph, his suit makes trouble between her and Gavin Goodluck, whose 
friend, Sim Suresby, reports that the widow is listening to other suitors. There is 
much amusing repartee, several funny scenes, and all ends well. </summary>

'Mycenae,' 'Greek Music and Painting,' etc., show something of the scope of the 
volume. From his study of the ancient Greek literature, Professor Mahaffy had 
reached the conclusion that it greatly idealized the old Greeks. In his 'Social 
Life in Greece,' 1874, he described them as he thought they actually were; and this 
description very nearly agrees, he says, with what he found in modern Greece. He 
judges that the modern Greeks like the ancients as he sees them are not a

an old Mexican estate in Southern California, where the Senora Moreno lives, with her 
son Felipe, and her adopted daughter Ramona, a beautiful half-breed, Scotch and 
Indian. Ramona betroths herself to Alessandro, a young Indian of noble character. 
Senora Moreno forbidding the marriage, they elope, to face a series of cruel misfortunes. The Indians of Alessandro f s village are deprived, of their land by the greed

race drives them, sooner or later, to remoter shelters. The proud and passionate 
Alessandro is driven mad by his wrongs, and his story ends in tragedy, though a sunset 
light of peace falls at last on Ramona. So rich is the story in local color, the frolic 
and toil of the sheep-shearing, the calm opulence of the sun-steeped vineyards, the 
busy ranch, the Indian villages; so strong is it in character, the bigoted just chatelaine, the tender Ramona, the good old priest, that its effect of reality is unescapable; and Californians still point out with pleased pride the low-spreading hacienda

wealthy aunt, where she is surrounded by the enervating influences of wealth and 
social ambitions; Frank, into a simply country home, where her lovable character 
develops in its proper environment. They marry, become mothers, and reaching 
middle age come, at the wish of their rich bachelor uncle Titus Oldways, to live near 
him in Boston. The episodes in the two households, the Ripwinkleys and Ledwiths, 
so widely divergent in character, complete the story; which, while never rising above 
the ordinary and familiar, yet, like the pictures of the old Dutch interiors, charms 
with its atmosphere of repose. It is a work for mothers and daughters alike. It 
exhibits the worth of the domestic virtues and the vanity of all worldly things; but 
it never becomes preachy. Its New England atmosphere is genuine, and the sayings 
of the characters are often racy of the soil; while the author's sense of humor carries 
her safely over some obstacles of emotion which might easily become sentimentality.</summary>
  <summary author="Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith (1856-1923)" title="Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" print_title="Rebecca\nof\nSunnybrook Farm">REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM, by Kate Douglas Wiggin (1903). This 
is the story of a quaint and original little girl, whose trite sayings are a constant source 
of amusement to the reader. Rebecca Randall is one of seven children and their 
mother being a widow with nothing but a mortgaged farm for their support, they 
have known little besides work and privation. Nevertheless, Rebecca, blest with 
an optimistic spirit, sees the silver lining in the clouds and makes the best of her 
surroundings. At the age of ten she leaves home to go to live with her mother's 
two unmarried sisters, Miranda and Jane, who are to take charge of her and send 
her to school, Rebecca makes the journey to Riverboro' alone by stage and in so 
doing wins the heart of the stage-driver, Mr. Cobb, who becomes her staunch 
friend. Her life in her new home is full of trials as her aunt Miranda is severe 
and unreasonable, but Rebecca by her winning ways practically softens her hard 
nature. At school Rebecca finds a friend and congenial spirit in Emma Jane 
Perkins and their intimacy continues throughout the story. Rebecca's aptness at 
her lessons and her originality of thought and expression arouse the interest of her 
teacher who does all she can to aid her progress. In Mr. Adam Ladd, a kind and 
generous young man, Rebecca finds the prince of her fairy tales and she calls him 
"Mr. Aladdin," after that hero of romance. Mr. Ladd does much to add to Rebecca's 
happiness and his interest in her becomes so deep that at the close of the story it is 
plainly seen that his feelings have turned to something more serious. The reader 
takes leave of Rebecca after her graduation from the seminary, on which occasion 
she is class poet and carries off many honors. Aunt Miranda, after a long and tedious 
illness, dies, leaving her house and land to Rebecca, who is made happy by the thought 
that it is in her power to bring comfort and happiness to her mother and brothers and 
sisters.</summary>
  <summary author="Kemble, Fanny (1809-1893)" title="Records of a Girlhood" print_title="Records\nof a\nGirlhood">RECORDS OF A GIRLHOOD, by Frances Anne Kemble (1879). This work gives 
the history of the life of a great actress, member of a family of genius, from her birth 
up to the time of her marriage (1809-34). Her incorrigible childhood, her schooldays in France, her first visit to the theatre, her early efforts at authorship, her 
distaste for the stage, her first appearance on it, her successes there, the books she 
has been reading, her first visit to America, her comments on American life, which, to 
her, is so primitive as to seem barbarous, all this is duly set forth. Among those 
of whom she relates memorable recollections or anecdotes are Lord Melbourne, Rossini, 
Weber, Fanny Elssler, Sir Walter Scott, Talma, Miss Mitford, Theodore Hook, 
Arthur Hallam, John Sterling, Malibran, Queen Victoria, George Stephenson, Lord 
John Russell, Edmund Kean, Chancellor Kent, Edward Everett, Charles Sumner, 
and a hundred other personages of equal fame. She knew everybody who was 
worth knowing, was petted and spoiled by the highest society, and reigned as an 
uncrowned queen in whatever circle she delighted by her presence. She declares it 
to be her belief that her natural vocation was for opera-dancing; and says that she
ought to have been handsome, and would have been so, had she not been disfigured 
by an attack of small-pox at the age of sixteen, whose effects never wholly 
disappeared. 

The book is brightly written, is full of well-bred gossip, and always entertaining. </summary>

resumes its author's history at the point where 'Records of a Girlhood' leaves it 
namely, at her marriage with Mr. Pierce Butler in 1834; and ends with her return to 
America in 1848, and her success in earning by public readings a home at Lenox, 
Massachusetts. "With the exception of two visits to Europe, the first two-thirds of 
the book are given to her life in America; the last third, to her stay in Europe (1845-48). The record begins by describing some of the points at which her English ideas 
disagree with American ones. It is full of amusing comments on our life, its 
crudeness, unhealthiness, lack of leisure, and extravagance, and the discomforts of 
travel. She speaks with evident pleasure of her American friends, sets down many 
observations and plans for the abolition of slavery, as she studies it on her husband's 
plantation in Georgia, and makes, in short, a vivid picture of American social life in 
the first half of the century. She gives specific studies of Philadelphia, Niagara 
Falls, Rockaway Beach, Newport, Boston, Lenox, Baltimore, and Charleston. 
Though she has faith in American institutions, she is not without intelligent misgivings: 
"The predominance of spirit over matter indicates itself strikingly across the Atlantic, where, in the lowest strata of society, the native American rowdy, with a face 
as pure in outline as an ancient Greek coin, and hands and feet as fine as those of a 
Norman noble, strikes one dumb with the aspect of a countenance whose vile, ignoble 
hardness can triumph over such refinement of line and delicacy of proportion. A 
human soul has a wonderful supremacy over the matter which it informs. The 
American is a whole nation, with well-made, regular noses; from which circumstance 
(and a few others), I believe in their future superiority over all other nations. But 
the lowness their faces are capable of 'flogs Europe.' Her strictures on the English 
aristocracy, and middle and lower classes, are equally severe. In the last third of the 
book are described her return to the stage and her appearance as a public reader in 
England, in 1847. In 1841 she was on the Continent, and in 1846 in Italy. Most of 
this history is told in the form of letters written at the time, wherein her literary 
opinions and speculations on life and philosophy are freely expressed. Her anecdotes 
of Dr. Charming, Grisi, Lord and Lady Landsdowne, Sydney Smith, Lady Holland, 
Rogers, Wordsworth, Mrs. Somerville, Pollen, Taglioni, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Fanny 
Elssler, Mrs. Grote, Jenny Lind, Moore, Macaulay, Dickens, Dr. Arnold, Bunsen,

It attracted a great deal of attention both in England and America, by reason of the 
nature of the subject, and of the author's extreme youth. It is a study of a man's 
feeling in battle, written by one who was never in a battle, but who seeks to give color 
to his story by lurid language. Henry Fleming, an unsophisticated country boy, 
enthusiastic to serve his country, enlists at the beginning of the Civil War. Young, 
raw, intense, he longs to show his patriotism, to prove himself a hero. When the 
book opens he is fretting for an opportunity, his regiment apparently being nowhere 
near a scene of action. His mental states are described as he waits and chafes; the 
calculations as to what it would all be like when it did come, the swagger to keep up 
the spirits, the resentments of the possible superiority of his companions, the hot 
frenzy to be in the thick of it with the intolerable delays over, and sore doubts of 
courage. Suddenly, pell-mell, the boy is thrown into battle, gets frightened to 
death in the thick of it, and runs; after the fun is over, crawls back to his regiment 
fairly vicious with unbearable shame. The heroic visions fade; but the boy makes 
one step towards manhood through his wholesome lesson. In his next battle courage 
links itself to him like a brother-in-arms. He tests and is tested, goes into the thick 
of the fight like a howling demon, goes indeed to hell, and comes back again, steadied 
and quiet. The book closes on his new and manly serenity. 

"He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in 
the past. He had been an animal, blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of 
war. He now turned with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies."</summary>

the Vicomte de Saux, is one of the French nobility. His sympathy with the troubles 
of the French peasants leads him to adopt the Red Cockade, notwithstanding his 
ties of blood and his engagement to marry a young woman of a prominent Royalist 
family. He is constantly torn between loyalty to his convictions and to the woman

wounds received at the hands of the mob. Her elder son has been killed by the revolutionists. With the mother are Denise and Louis, and also the Vicomte de Saux. 
In her last moments she gives Denise to her lover. After their marriage the Vicomte

Chronicle of the Reconstruction,' and is a faithful portrayal of the political and 
social conditions which existed during that era. The scene is laid "partly in one of 
the old Southern States and partly in the land of memory" and opens just before 
the war. Red Rock is the name of a plantation which has been owned and occupied 
by the Gray family for many generations, and which takes its name from a rock with 
a huge red stain upon it, which was believed to be the blood of the Indian chief who 
had slain the wife of the first Jacquelin Gray. The present Jacquelin, the central 
figure of the story, is a young lad at the time of the breaking out of the war, and, 
after the death of his father in battle, he enlists, at the age of fifteen, to fight for the 
South. After many trying experiences, in which he shows great nobleness and courage, he returns home at the close of the war seriously wounded. He finds desolation 
and ruin all about him and is forced to witness his mother's death and her burial in 
alien soil, as their home and patrimony have been wrested from them by dishonest 
means. Jacquelin has always loved Blair Gary, the companion of his childhood 
days, but he holds aloof from her, thinking that she is in love with his dashing cousin, 
Steve Allen, and his suit does not prosper. After many thrilling episodes with 
"Carpet-baggers," Ku Klux raids, and law-suits, Jacquelin at last comes into his 
own, winning back the estate of his father and the hand of the girl he loves. Steve 
Allen, the hero of many exciting adventurers, marries Ruth Welch, a charming 
Northern girl who has come to make her home in the South. Dr. Gary, who figures 
prominently in the story, is a noble character and spends his last strength in visiting

  <summary author="Cooper, James Fenimore (1789-1851)" title="The Red Rover A Tale" print_title="The Red Rover\nA Tale">RED ROVER, THE, by James Fenimore Cooper (1827). This story relates to the 
days before the Revolutionary War; and is one of Cooper's most exciting sea tales. 
Henry Ark, a lieutenant on his Majesty's ship Dart, is desirous of distinguishing himself by aiding in the capture of the notorious pirate, the Red Rover. With this in 
view he goes to Newport, disguised as a common sailor under the name of Wilder, 
and joins the Rover's ship, the Dolphin, which is anchored there awaiting the dedeparture of a merchantman, the Caroline. The Captain of the Caroline meets with 
an accident and Wilder is sent by the Rover to take his place; shortly after he puts to 
sea followed by the Dolphin. A storm arises, and the Caroline is lost; the only 
survivors being Wilder, Miss Gertrude Grayson, a passenger, and Mrs. Wyllys, her 
governess, who are rescued by the Dolphin. Not long after, a royal cruiser is sighted. 
This proves to be the Dart; and the Rover, going on board of her in the guise of an 
officer in the royal navy, learns by accident of Wilder's duplicity. He returns to 
the Dolphin, and summoning his first mate accuses him of treachery; Wilder confesses 
the truth of the charge, and the Rover, in a moment of generosity, sends him back to 
his ship unharmed, together with the two ladies, without whom Wilder 'refuses to 
stir. The Rover then attacks the Dart, and takes it after a hard fight. He is about 
to have Wilder hanged, when it appears that he is a son of Mrs. Wyllys whom she 
has supposed drowned in infancy; and the Rover, unable to separate the new-found
son from his mother, sets them all off in a pinnace, in which they reach shore safely. 
After the close of the Revolutionary War a man is brought to the old inn at Newport 
in a dying condition: he proves to be the Red Rover, who, having reformed, has 
served through the war with credit and distinction. 

The book holds the interest of the reader throughout; and the descriptions of the

  <summary author="Scott, Walter (1771-1832)" title="Redgauntlet: A Tale Of The Eighteenth Century" print_title="Redgauntlet:\nA Tale\nOf The\nEighteenth Century">REDGAUNTLET, by Sir Walter Scott. Sir Alberick Redgauntlet, ardently espousing the cause of the Young Pretender in 1745, pays for his enthusiasm with his life. 
The guardianship of his infant son and daughter is left to his brother, outlawed for 
violent adherence to the House of Stuart; but the widow, ascribing her bereavement 
to the politics of the Redgauntlets, desires to rear her children in allegiance to the 
reigning dynasty. The little girl having been kidnapped by her guardian, the mother 
flees with her boy; who, ignorant of his lineage, is brought up in obscurity under the 
name of Darsie Latimer. Warned by his mother's agents to shun England, the 
young man ventures for sport into the forbidden territory, and is seized by Redgauntlet. Detained as a prisoner, Darsie at length learns his true name and rank, and meets 
his sister, now grown up to charming womanhood. Redgauntlet, a desperate partisan, endeavors by persuasion and threats to involve his nephew in a new plot to enthrone the Chevalier, and conveys the youth by force to the rendezvous of the 
conspirators. Meanwhile, Darsie's disappearance has alarmed his devoted friend, 
Alan Fairford, a young Scotch solicitor; who, in spite of great danger, traces him to 
the gathering-place of the conspiring Jacobites. The plot, predestined to failure 
through Charles Edward's obstinate rejection of conditions, is betrayed by Redgauntlet's servant, and the conspirators quickly dispersed, their position rendered 
absurd by the good-natured clemency of George III. Redgauntlet, chagrined at the 
fiasco, accompanies the Chevalier to France, and ends his adventurous career in a 
monastery. Darsie, now Sir Arthur Redgauntlet, remains loyal to the House of 
Hanover, and bestows his sister's hand upon Alan Fairford (in whom, according to 
Lockhart, Scott drew his own portrait). 

Sixteenth in the Waverley series, 'Redgauntlet' was issued in 1824, two years 
before the crash that left Scott penniless. Though showing haste, the tale does not 
flag in interest, and even the minor characters notably Peter Peebles the crazy 
litigant, Wandering Willie the vagabond fiddler, and Nanty Ewart, the smuggler 
are living and individual.</summary>

George Darrow, meets his first love, Anna Leath, who had married abroad, and is 
recently a widow. Darrow is on his way to her in France, when he receives a telegram 
asking him to postpone his visit. Chilled and disappointed, and uncertain how to 
spend his holiday, he chances to meet Sophie Viner, a young American acquaintance, 
companion to a Mrs. Murrett in London, who has turned her adrift almost penniless. 
She is on her way to friends in Paris, and her courage and gay youth appeal to him. 
When they discover her friends have left Paris, he follows his impulse to give her a 
little of the pleasure she has missed, and they drift into a temporary and irregular 
connection. This episode becomes the "reef," which wrecks their later lives. Darrow visits France as Anna's fiance, several months later, and finds Sophie Viner 
installed in the household as governess to Anna's daughter, and engaged to be married 
to Owen, her stepson. The secret of their former acquaintance is discovered. Sophie 
loyally throws up her prospects and goes back to the service of Mrs.. Murrett, to keep 
the memory of Darrow, whom she loves. Anna comes to understand and forgive 
Sophie and Darrow, but jealousy of their past intimacy makes it impossible for her 
to marry him. The author's well-known powers of psychological analysis have full 
scope in the distinction of the characters and the delicate situations which result.</summary>

of poetical parodies was issued anonymously in 1812, and met with great success, 
both the critics and the public being delighted with the clever imitations; though, 
strange to say, the authors had much difficulty in finding a publisher for the book. 
The 'Rejected Addresses' were the joint work of the brothers James and Horace 
Smith, who wrote them as a burlesque upon the many prominent and unsuccessful 
competitors for the reward offered by the management of the Drury Lane for an 
address to be delivered at the opening of the new theatre. The ' Rejected Addresses ' 
were begun at this time, and were completed in a few weeks. Among the imitations 
set forth in the volume, the following are the work of James Smith: 'The Baby's 
Dbut' (Wordsworth), 'The Hampshire Farmer's Address' (Cobbett), 'The Rebuilding' (Southey), 'Play-House Musings' (Coleridge), 'The Theatre' (Crabbe), the 
first stanza of 'Cui Bono' (Lord Byron); the song entitled 'Drury Lane Hustings'; 
and 'The Theatrical Alarm-Bell, ' an imitation of the Morning Post; also travesties 
on 'Macbeth,' 'George Bamwell,' and 'The Stranger.' The rest of the imitations 
are by Horace Smith. The ' Rejected Addresses ' were widely commended in their 
day, and still hold a high place among the best imitations ever made. Their extent 
and variety exhibited the versatility of the authors. Although James wrote the 
greater number of successful imitations, the one by Horace, of Scott, is perhaps the 
best of the parodies; and its amusing picture of the burning of Drury Lane Theatre is 
an absurd imitation of the battle in 'Marmion': 

    "The firemen terrified are slow 
    To bid the pumping torrent flow, 

    For fear the roof would fall. 
    Back, Robins, back; Crump stand aloof!

  <summary author="Mill, John Stuart (1806-1873)" title="Considerations on Representative Government" print_title="Considerations on\nRepresentative Government">REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, Considerations on, by J. S. Mill (1860). 
This work, though written in 1860, is still the best statement in English of the case 
for representative government. The author, being of opinion at the time the book 
was composed that both Conservatives and Liberals had lost confidence in the creeds 
which they nominally professed without having made any progress towards providing 
themselves with a better, attempts to state a doctrine which is "not a mere compromise, by splitting the difference between the two, but something wider than either, 
which in virtue of its superior comprehensiveness, might be adopted by either Liberal
or Conservative without renouncing anything which he really feels to be valuable in 
his own creed." The keynote of the book is that political institutions are the work 
of men and owe their origin and their whole existence to human will. Similarly as 
they were first made by men, so they have to be worked by men and even by ordinary 
men. It is plain, therefore, that they can be altered or removed by human will, but 
whatever alteration or change is made must be of such a character as to suit existing 
conditions. "The most important point of excellence," he says, "which any form 
of government can possess is to promote the virtue and intelligence of the people 
themselves. The first question in respect to any political institution is. how far they 
tend to foster in the members of the community the various desirable qualities, 
moral or intellectual." The ideally best form of government, whereby Mill means 
the one which is practical and eligible under the circumstances, is the representative 
because "the rights and interests of every and any person are only secure from being 
disregarded, when the person interested is himself able, and habitually disposed to 
stand up for them" and because "the general prosperity attains a greater height, 
and is more widely diffused, in proportion to the amount and variety of the personal 
energies enlisted in promoting it."</summary>
  <summary author="Plato (-428--348)" title="The Republic" print_title="The Republic">REPUBLIC, THE, of Plato (c. 398-360 B. C.), translated by Benjamin Jowett 
(1891-92). The 'Republic* of Plato is the first and perhaps the greatest treatise 
on education. He is the first writer who has a distinct grasp of the thought that 
education should comprehend the whole of life and be preparatory to another in which 
education is to begin again. True knowledge is not something which is to be imposed 
from without but elicited from within, and education will implant a principle of intelligence which is better than ten thousand eyes. The Platonic conception of education 
is not as it were to fill an empty vessel, but to turn the eye of the soul towards the light. 
The child is first to be taught the simple religious truths, which are only two in 
number, that God is true and that he is good. It follows, therefore, that children 
should not be taught the old mythology, which largely consists of descriptions of the 
treacherous and scandalous conduct of the gods. After these religious truths come 
moral truths and unconsciously the child will learn what are the most important things 
next to religion, good manners, and good taste. The work of education is to be 
carried on not only in an atmosphere of desire for truth, but of repose. Children, 
therefore, should not be taken to dramatic entertainments, which are exciting for 
young people. Education should be a harmonious growth, in which are learnt the 
lessons of temperance and endurance, and the body and mind develop simultaneously 
in equal proportions. The great principle to be recognized in all art and nature, and 
the principle which must dominate education also, is simplicity. 

The next stage of education is gymnastic, which, however, is not primarily a 
training of the body, but of the mind. Its aim should be to discipline the passionate 
element in human nature, as the purpose of music, which should follow gymnastic, is 
to restrain the acquisitive and draw out the rational within us. After music and 
gymnastic, which should make the training of the mind their chief aim, education 
should begin again from a new point of view. "True knowledge" (says Jowett) 
"according to Plato is of abstractions, and has to do, not with particulars or individuals, but with universals only; not with the beauties of poetry, but with the ideas 
of philosophy, and the great aim of education is the cultivation of the habit of abstraction. This is to be acquired through the study of the mathematical sciences. They 
alone are capable of giving ideas of relation, and of arousing the dormant energies 
of thought." See also 'Dialogues' of Plato.</summary>
  <summary author="Wells, H. G. (Herbert George) (1866-1946)" print_title="The Research\nMagnificent" title="The Research Magnificent">RESEARCH MAGNIFICENT, THE, by H. G. Wells (1915). William Benham 
at an early age realizes that there are certain bounds to the attainment of what he 
calls "aristocratic living." The First of these is Fear. It comes to him when as a 
little boy he is shut in a field with an angry bull; and when he is "dared" to deny God 
in a thunderstorm. As he grows older, Benham takes heroic methods to overcome 
fear, both physical and mental. Knowledge of the Second Limit, Indulgence, comes 
to him as a grown man. He realizes it indirectly through his friend Prothero's 
struggles against temptations and through a knowledge of his mother's past. The 
experience comes to him directly through his entanglement with a fascinating widow, 
Mrs. Skelmersdale. Weary of her blandishments, he goes on a walking tour. In a 
particularly lovely part of England, he meets, wooes, and marries Amanda Morris. 
With her he continues his search for the best in life. Amanda is occasionally bored. 
It is evident that she would have preferred a rational honeymoon to dangerous jaunts 
in Arabia and Asia Minor, probing into the hearts of men. Before long she inveigles 
her husband back to London and tries to break him into fashionable life. Benham 
refuses to quit his research and goes abroad again, this time with his friend, Billy 
Prothero. While the young men are studying Russia in revolution, word comes 
to Benham that his wife has been untrue to him. A hasty trip to England confirms 
the rumor. It is at this juncture in his career that Benham discovers the Third 
Barrier Jealousy. After a hard fight he conquers his mad rage, settles a comfortable sum on Amanda, offers her a divorce, and leaves England, this time for good. In 
the course of his wanderings over the globe, Benham formulates a Fourth Limit to 
the "aristocracy" he wants to achieve Prejudice: prejudice against a man because 
he is of a different color, or of a different degree of intelligence. He dies in Johannesburg in an attempt to obliterate this barrier: seeing a troop of English soldiers firing 
on insurgent natives, he puts himself in the way and dies in the arms of his friend, 
White, to whom he entrusts the formulating of the ideal for which he was striven.</summary>
  <summary author="Tolstoy, Leo, graf (1828-1910)" title="Resurrection" print_title="Resurrection">RESURRECTION, by Count Lyov N. Tolstoy, published in 1900, presents in the 
author's usual powerful vein the absorbing theme of the development of a great 
character, besides offering a picture of Russian society, from the wealthy officeholding circle, to the peasants and common soldiers, jailers, and criminal classes. 
Nekhludoff, a well-to-do Russian noble, who enjoys his money and his superficial 
society existence and takes his views of life without questioning, from the atmosphere 
around him is one day called on for jury duty. One of the cases he has to try is that 
of a woman who is accused of poisoning a merchant for his money. Nekhludoff, to his 
horror, recognizes in the prisoner a girl from his aunt's estate with whom he had 
fallen in love as a young man and seduced. He is overcome by the realization of his 
personal responsibility for the crime in question, a responsibility which he is conscious of holding first towards the girl and second towards the community at large. 
Through the technical ignorance of the jury Katusha is condemned to penal servitude 
in Siberia, and Nekhludoff makes up his mind to follow her, win her back to a true 
life, and many her. The story is a study of his gradual winning of a higher life for 
himself by coming in contact with the peasants and exiles with whom he must needs 
associate in his endeavor to do right by Katusha. Thus in his effort to right the 
wrong he has done to another, he unconsciously rights the wrong done in himself by 
the false social outlook and inadequate education which had made him what he was, 
and he constructs for himself a new and broadly human creed of living. In this story 
Tolstoy reveals his wonderful power of handling innumerable details and of presenting a supremely realistic picture of Russian life.</summary>

country " the district of which he has made an ideal map for the latest edition of 
his works. The hero of the book, the "native," is Clym Yeobright, formerly a 
jeweler in Paris, but now returned to the village of his birth, on Egdon Heath. The 
giving up of his trade is due to his desire to lead a broader, more unselfish life. He 
plans to open a school in the village, and to educate and uplift the rustics about him. 
His Quixotic schemes of helpfulness are upset, however, by his falling in love with 
Eustacia Vye, a beautiful, passionate, discontented woman, "the raw material of a 
divinity." His marriage with her is the beginning of a troubled life, severed far 
enough from his ideals. Her self-sought death by drowning leaves him free to begin 
again his cherished career of usefulness. As an open-air preacher he seeks an outlet 
for his philanthropic spirit. The story of Yeobright and Eustacia is not the exclusive 
interest of the book. Many rustic characters, drawn as only Hardy can draw them, 
lend to it a delightful rural flavor which relieves the gloom of its tragic incidents.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Richard II" print_title="Richard II">RICHARD II, by Shakespeare (printed 1597). This drama (based on Holinshed's 
'Chronicle') tells the story of the supplanting, on the throne of England, of the 
handsome and sweet-natured, but weak-willed Richard II, by the politic Bolingbroke 
(Henry IV.). The land is impoverished by Richard's extravagances. He is surrounded by flatterers and boon companions (Bushy, Bagot, and Green), and has lost 
the good- will of his people. The central idea of 'Richard II' is that the kingly office 
cannot be maintained without strength of brain and hand. Old John of Gaunt (or 
Ghent) is loyal to Richard; but on his death-bed sermons him severely, and dying, 
prophesies of England, "this seat of Mars, " 

    "This fortress built by Nature for herself 
    Against infection and the hand of war, 
    This happy breed of men, this little world." 

Richard lets him talk; but no sooner is the breath out of his body than he seizes 
all his movable or personal wealth and that of his banished son Bolingbroke, to get 
money for his Irish wars. This step costs Richard his throne. While absent in 
Ireland, Bolingbroke lands with a French force, to regain his property and legal rights 
as a nobleman and open the purple testament of bleeding war. The country rises to 
welcome him. Even a force in Wales, tired of waiting for Richard, who was detained 
by contrary winds, disperses just a day before he landed. Entirely destitute of 
troops, he humbly submits, and in London a little later gives up his crown to Henry 
IV. Richard is imprisoned at Pomf ret Castle. Here, one day, he is visited by a man 
who was formerly a poor groom of his stable, and who tells him how it irked him to 
see his roan Barbary with Bolingbroke on his back on coronation day, stepping along 
as if proud of his new master. Just then one Exton appears, in obedience to a hint 
from Henry IV., with men armed to kill. Richard at last (but too late) shows a 
manly spirit; and snatching a weapon from one of the assassins, kills him and then 
another, but is at once struck dead by Exton. Henry IV. lamented this bloody deed 
to the day of his death, and it cost him dear in the censures of his people. </summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Richard III" print_title="Richard III">RICHARD III., by Shakespeare (printed 1597), the last of a closely linked group of* 
historical tragedies. (See 'Henry VI. 1 ) Still a popular play on the boards; Edwin 
Booth as Richard will long be remembered. As the drama opens, Clarence the 
brother of Richard (or Gloster as he is called) is being led away to the Tower, where, 
through Gloster's intrigues, he is soon murdered on a royal warrant. The dream of 
Clarence is a famous passage, how he thought Richard drowned him at sea; and 
in hell the shade of Prince Edward, whom he himself had helped to assassinate at 
Tewkesbury, wandered by, its bright hair dabbled in blood, and crying: 

    "Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence." 

Gloster also imprisons the son of Clarence, and meanly matches Clarence's 
daughter. The Prince Edward mentioned was son of the gentle Henry VI., whom 
Richard stabbed in the Tower. This hunch-backed devil next had the effrontery 
to woo to wife Anne, widow of the Edward he had slain. She had not a moment's 
happiness with him, and deserved none. He soon killed her, and announced his 
intention of seeking the hand of Elizabeth, his niece, after having hired one Tyrrel 
to murder her brothers, the tender young princes, sons of Edward IV., in the Tower. 
Tyrrel employed two hardened villains to smother these pretty boys; and even the 
murderers wept as they told how they lay asleep, "girdling one another within their 
innocent alabaster arms," a prayer book on their pillow, and their red lips almost 
touching. The savage boar also stained himself with the blood of Lord Hastings, 
of the brother and son of Edward IV.'s widow, and of Buckingham, who, almost as 
remorseless as himself, had helped him to the crown, but fell from him when he asked 
him to murder the young princes. At length at Bosworth Field the monster met his 
match in the person of Richmond, afterward Henry VII. On the night before the 
battle, the poet represents each leader as visited by dreams, Richmond seeing 
pass before him the ghosts of all whom Richard has murdered, who encourage him 
and bid him be conqueror on the morrow; and Richard seeing the same ghosts pass 
menacingly by him, bidding him despair and promising to sit heavy on his soul on the 
day of battle. He awakes, cold drops of sweat standing on his brow; the lights burn 
blue in his tent: "Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am: then fly. What, 
from myself?" Day breaks; the battle is joined; Richard fights with fury, and his 
horse is killed under him: "A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!" But soon 
brave Richmond has him down, crying, "The day is ours: the bloody dog is dead." </summary>
  <summary author="Haeckel, Ernst (1834-1919)" title="The Riddle of the Universe" print_title="The Riddle\nof the\nUniverse">RIDDLE OF THE UNIVERSE, THE ('Die Weltrasel'), a metaphysical and scientific 
treatise by Ernst Haeckel, was published in German in 1899 and in an English translation by Joseph McCabe in 1901. An eminent and prolific scientific investigator, 
a passionate admirer of Darwin, and uniting power of minute research with bold 
metaphysical speculation, Haeckel put forth this book at the close of a long career of 
biological discovery, in defense of the extremest form of materialistic monism. From 
the chemical law of the indestructibility of matter and the physical law of the conservation of energy he formulates the law of substance or "law of the persistence 
of matter and force"; and he strives to prove that this law is sufficient in itself to 
account for all known phenomena, material, mental, and spiritual. He holds with 
Spinoza that matter and energy "are but two inseparable attributes of the one 
underlying substance." The dualistic idea of a personal God above or outside of 
Nature, of an immortal soul distinct from the body, and of the freedom of the will 
undetermined by causality, he regards as delusions, due to a false conception of the 
central importance of man in the cosmos. An eternal process of evolution and 
devolution is constantly producing and then destroying the various planetary systems; 
on one of these planets, the earth, and possibly on all the others, life has arisen and 
developed, the lower species gradually evolving into higher all under the impulse of 
purely mechanical and material forces. Consciousness is a vital property of every 
living organism and is a purely natural phenomenon. Man's body and soul have 
arisen by a process of natural evolution from the lowest forms of existence. Ethical 
principles have evolved from the social necessities of man in association with his 
fellow men. Dogmatic religion is a hindrance to man's progress, a cause of unhappiness and misery, and above all a delusion. There can be no compromise between 
Christianity and modern science; the former is based on a mistaken dualistic view of 
the universe and is essentially hostile to worldly learning, happiness, and progress. 
Idealistic philosophy and all dualistic systems are equally untenable. 

Haeckel is the ablest defender of the materialistic attitude since Darwin, Hu-Jey, 
and Tyndall, and goes beyond them in the sweeping and positive nature of his opinions.</summary>

to the spinning wheel. Nora, a young sister, puts her head in at the door, and takes 
from under her shawl a bundle given her by the young priest. In it are a shirt and 
stocking "got off a drowned man in Donegal." The priest has given them to her to 
find out if they belong to her brother Michael, who has been missing. Her father 
and four other brothers have all been drowned fishing. Maurya, the mother, tries

threatening. "It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're drowned with the rest. 
What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman looking for the grave?" 
Bartley insists on going and when he is gone, Maurya, who had gone down to the well,

(1848), is one of the author's most famous historical romances. It is founded on the 
career of Cola di Rienzi, who, in the fourteenth century, inspired by visions of restoring the ancient greatness of Rome, made himself for seven months master of that 
imperial city, and after nearly seven years of exile and excommunication, during part 
of which he was a prisoner, repeated the triumph, finally dying at the people's hands 
in 1354. Bulwer was so impressed with the heroism and force of character of his 
hero, that at first he meditated writing his biography, instead of a romance founded 
on his life. The story adheres very closely to the historical facts. To secure accuracy and vividness of setting, the novelist went to Rome to live while writing it. 
Rienzi 's contradictory character, and above all, his consummate ability, and the 
ambitious and unprincipled yet heroic nature of his rival, Walter de Montreal, are 
skillfully drawn. Among the lesser personages, Irene, Rienzi's gentle sister, and 
Nina, his regal wife, with her love of the poetry of wealth and power; Irene's lover, 
Adrian di Castello, the enlightened noble; Cecco del Vecchio, the sturdy smith; and 
the ill-fated Angelo Villani, are prominent. Many of the situations and scenes are 
very strong. The treatment is epic rather than dramatic; and the splendid yet 
comfortless civilization of the Middle Ages, so picturesque and so squalid, so ecstatic 
and so base, is vividly delineated.</summary>
  <summary author="Parker, Gilbert (1862-1932)" title="The Right of Way" print_title="The Right of Way">RIGHT OF WAY, THE, by Sir Gilbert Parker (1901). In this powerful story the 
author has set forth with a master's touch the study of a man's soul. "Beauty 
Steele," the brilliant barrister, who is thought to have been wiped out of existence in 
a drunken brawl, awakens in absolutely new surroundings and as Charles Mallard 
begins a new life, which, though unhampered by previous ties and associations, is 
ever menaced by old tendencies to vice. The metamorphose from the drunken fop to 
the well-loved tailor is attained through a sequence of natural events, none of them 
beyond the pale of possibility, and the working out of the story to its unexpected 
conclusion is natural, just what might have happened under the same circumstances 
in real life. The atmosphere of a quaint little Canadian village, with its simple folk 
and simple ways, is a pleasing background for the story of this man's duplex life, 
filled as it is with its tragic problems of love and sorrow. The character of Rosalie 
Evanturel, the lovely daughter of the village postmaster, is delightfully fresh and 
original. In her, Charles Mallard finds his real affinity, and his love for her becomes 
the ruling motive in his second existence. The story, while psychological, is full of 
dramatic interest and yet carries to the end a perfect sense of proportion and a 
wonderful resemblance to nature. Mr. Parker handles his problem of presenting 
this double existence with the greatest skill, and, with a true artistic touch, does not, 
even at the end, lift the curtain which separates the new life from the old. Kathleen, 
once the wife of " Beauty Steele, " whose arrival on the scene gives her an opportunity 
to enter the chamber of death and recognize the erstwhile brilliant barrister, goes 
away unenlightened as to his prolonged existence, leaving Rosalie Evanturel kneeling 
by his bier.</summary>

Britain and shifts from Scotland to England. The hero of the tale is a young Scotsman named Robert Fordyce, familiarly called Robin. When first introduced to 
the reader he is on his way to Edinburgh to try for a scholarship which will enable 
him to attend the University. Born and bred on a farm and reared by sober and God-fearing parents, Robin has the big physique and honest nature which usually results 
from such environment. Successful in his efforts he passes his examinations and wins 
the highest honors, goes through the University and prepares to study for the ministry, when his brother's failing health causes him to abandon his career in order to help 
support the family. He takes up journalism and labors at it faithfully for three 
years but relinquishes it gladly to become private secretary to Adrian Inglethwaite, 
M. P. While occupying this position Robin lives in his employer's family and is 
thrown in daily contact with Airs. Inglethwaite J s pretty twin sisters named respectively Dolly and Dilly. These two fascinating damsels are so exactly alike that they 
puzzle even their own family and they amuse themselves by mixing up their various 
admirers. To their great surprise Robin discovers a slight difference in them upon 
their first meeting and never thereafter mistakes one for the other. Dilly marries 
Richard Lever and on the night of her wedding Robin tells Dolly of his love for her 
but says he shall not propose to her until he has become worthy of her. This original 
method of love-making is new to Dolly and at first she does not know just how to 
take it. Time goes on, however, and just as a critical election is in progress the 
Inglethwaite's little girl Phyllis is taken seriously ill. This crisis brings the love 
affair to a climax and though the election is lost, Phyllis recovers, and Dolly acknowledges her love for Robin before he has reached the point of claiming her. The 
reader takes leave of them fifteen years later when Robin has become the Right 
Honorable Sir Robert Fordyce, Privy Councillor and Secretary of State. </summary>

Translation and Notes, by Dr. William Whewell. (3 vols., 1853. Translation 
alone, i vol.) One of the most interesting, most significant, and most permanently 
important of books. Its importance, to the present day as in the past, is that of the 
earliest and greatest work designed to apply the principles of humanity, not only to 
the conduct of war but to the whole conduct of nations, on the plan of finding these 
principles in human nature and human social action. The works of Albericus 
Gentilis (1588), and Ayala (1597), had already dealt with the laws of war. To Grotius belongs the honor of founder of the law of nature and of nations. The significance 
of the original work, published at Frankfort in 1625, when the Thirty Years' War was 
making a carnival of blood and terror in Europe, is the application of Christian humanity to the conduct of war, and to the intercourse of nations, which Grotius proposed. The work is one of immense learning, in Roman law especially; and although 
executed in one year, with his brother's aid in the large number of quotations, it in 
fact represented the studies of twenty years, and filled out an outline first written 
in 1604. The whole history of the author is of exceptional interest. A most 
versatile scholar at an early age, a translator of Greek poetry into Latin verse of high 
poetic quality, a Dutch historian in a Latin style worthy of Tacitus, and a Christian 
commentator and apologist of broadly humanist enlightenment, superior even to 
Erasmus, he was also one of the most attractive characters of his time.</summary>
  <summary author="Coleridge, Samuel Taylor (1772-1834)" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" print_title="The Rime\nof the\nAncient Mariner">RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER, THE, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first 
appeared in 'Lyrical Ballads' (1798). It is one of the most fantastic and original 
poems in the English language. An attempt at analysis is difficult; for, as has been 
happily said: "The very music of its words is like the melancholy, mysterious 
breath of something sung to the sleeping ear; its images have the beauty, the grandeur, the incoherence, of some mighty vision. The loveliness and the terror glide before 
us in turns, with, at one moment, the awful shadowy dimness, at another the yet 
more awful distinctness, of a majestic dream." A wedding guest is on his way to the 
bridal festivities. He hears the merry minstrelsy, and sees the lights in the distance. 
An old gray-bearped man the Ancient Mariner stops him to tell him a story, and 
although the wedding guest refuses to listen, he is held by the fixed glance of the 
mysterious stranger. The Ancient Mariner describes his voyage, how his ship was 
locked in the ice, and how he shot with his crossbow the tame Albatross, the bird of 
good omen which perched upon the vessel. The entire universe seemed stunned by 
this wanton act of cruelty: the sea and sky sicken, the sun becomes withered and 
bloody, no winds move the ship, "idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean "; slimy 
things creep upon the slimy sea, death- fires dance about the vessel; and the Albatross 
hangs around the neck of the Ancient Mariner. A spectre ship appears, and the crew 
die, leaving the graybeard alone. After a time he is moved to prayer, whereupon 
the evil spell is removed. The Albatross sinks into the sea, and the Mariner's heart 
is once again a part of the universal spirit of love. After hearing this story, the 
wedding guest "turns from the bridegroom's door," and 

    "A sadder and a wiser man 
    He rose the morrow morn."
    
The weird ballad is capable of many interpretations; for the Ancient Mariner is 
nameless, there is no name for the ship, and her destination is vague. In its small 
compass it contains a tragedy of remorse, and of redemption through repentance. 
The imagery is wonderful, and the poem is pervaded by a noble mystery. Wordsworth, Coleridge affirms, wrote the last two lines of the first stanza of Part iv. </summary>

of a young man named Roscoe Paine who on account of his invalid mother is 
spending years of enforced idleness in a little town on Cape Cod. Six years previously Mrs. Paine had been stricken with a severe illness which had made her helpless, 
and dependent upon the companionship of her only son, who had given up a position 
in the banking-house in the city, which he had held since leaving college, and had 
settled down in the town of Denboro, to lead the life of a recluse and an idler. The 
son of an embezzler who had ruined his family, and deserted them, and committed 
suicide when exposure threatened, Roscoe felt that his father's disgrace had cast a 
blot upon his life which could never be erased. Accordingly he and his mother had
hidden themselves from the world and under an assumed name were trying to live 
down their affliction. The arrival in Denboro of a rich New York financier named 
Colton, who builds himself a palatial residence causes a stir in local circles. Mr. 
Colton has an only daughter named Mabel who is a most attractive girl. She has 
an accidental meeting with Roscoe whom she takes for a "native" and treats as such. 
Later on, Roscoe several times comes to her rescue and saves her from disasters of 
various kinds, and she begins to appreciate his strength and character. Mr. Colton 
desires to buy a strip of land belonging to Roscoe and offers a fabulous sum for it, 
but he refuses to sell, wishing to retain the land as a convenient thoroughfare for his 
neighbors. Finally, however, he is obliged to relinquish it in order to procure money 
to save a friend from disgrace. Mr. Colton is taken suddenly ill and while unconscious a crisis arises in his affairs which is successfully met by Roscoe. Before his 
illness Mr. Colton had offered Roscoe a position in his business but the latter had 
declined not wishing to reveal his identity. Mr. Colton becomes convalescent and 
renews his offer so urgently that Roscoe decides to tell him everything. When Mr. 
Colton learns that he is the son of Carleton Bennet whom he had known before his 
downfall, he becomes even more interested in Roscoe and gives his daughter to him 
in marriage though the latter had felt that in his position he had no right to aspire

effort which met with instant success and has remained a favorite on the stage 
ever since, was written when he was but twenty-four. It contains a whole gallery of 
characters which have become household words. Sir Anthony Absolute is a variant 
of the hackneyed character, the angry father. Sir Lucius Trigger hits off the dueling habits of his fellow-countrymen of that time. Bob Acres is perhaps the best 
known blockhead on the comic stage. Mrs. Malaprop's "derangement of epithets" 
is a never-failing source of amusement. Lydia Languish, that extraordinary compound of extravagance and simplicity, who wanted a husband but thought it would be 
tame to have one without an elopement is the most attractive of maidens. Faulkland 
is the personification of perversity, who always has a grievance and never loses an 
opportunity of making himself and other people miserable. The interest in the plot 
of the play never flags, and the wit and brilliance of the dialogue are sustained 
throughout. The characters bear strong resemblances to figures in plays bv earlier 
authors, but to use the words of Hazlitt it "appears to have been the peculiar forte 
and the great praise of our author's genius, that he could imitate with the spirit of an

Virgil; Vol. iii., Horace and the Elegiac Poets (1863-97). The entire work forms one 
of the most scholarly, complete, and interesting contributions to the history of 
literature ever written. The author is not only a classical critic of the first order, of 
ripe scholarship and fine literary taste, but his appreciation of Roman culture, 
profound and exact, and his exceptional power of lucid exposition, have enabled him 
to give Roman intellectual culture of the finer sort its due, in comparison with Greek, 
to an extent not elsewhere done. Largely as Roman genius in Latin literature was 
fed from Greek sources, it was yet more original and independent than has been 
commonly supposed. The whole level of Latin culture is at once lifted and illuminated in Dr. Sellar's wonderfully rich and glowing pages. The volume devoted 
to Virgil is unsurpassed in any language as a masterpiece of interpretation and of 
delightful critical praise. The writer's outlook is not that of a Latin chair alone: it is 
that of humanity and of universal culture; that of Greek and English and European 
history; to bring Roman mind into comparison with all the great types of mind in all 
lands and of all ages. To know what the deeper spiritual developments of the Roman 
world were when Christ came, what were the rays of light and the clouds of darkness 
at the dawn of the new faith, readers can hardly find a better guide than this study

pursue a professor's life at Rome. Nino has the audacity to fall in love at first sight 
with Hedwig, daughter of Count von Lira. Won by the beautiful tenor voice, 
Hedwig fully returns his love. They arouse the suspicions of the father, a "cold, 
hard, narrow man, " who secretly carries his daughter to an obscure castle in the 
Abruzzi. 

Nino searches Paris and London in vain for a trace of Hedwig. Meanwhile his 
father gets a hint of the probable whereabouts of the Liras, and immediately starts 
on a search for them. Careful inquiries extract the desired information. He takes 
up his abode near the castle, and at last, by enormous bribes to a servant, secures an 
interview with Hedwig. From her he learns of her great unhappiness; of her father's 
' purpose to keep her a prisoner until she consents to marry Benoni, a rich Jew; and 
of her own determination never to yield. 

When Nino arrives he seeks the count, and asks for his daughter's hand. He is
refused, and thereupon determines to take her away without her father's consent, if 
it is her own wish. Hedwig succeeds in escaping to Nino by an unused stair and door. 
On mules that are in readiness they climb the Abruzzi to points that horses cannot 
reach. After being married at a little village in the mountains, they return to Rome, 
where there are interesting scenes with the old count, who refuses to be reconciled, 
and with Benoni, who turns out to be insane. 

The story ends with the prospective return of Grandi to his old estate at Serveti. 
The charm of this book is in its good, healthy romance, its honest, straightforward 
love-making without mawkish sentimentalism. With its strong Italian atmosphere, 
and its ingenious situations following one another in quick succession, it carries us 
quite out of ourselves. The characters are strongly and consistently drawn. </summary>

wives for the settlers in New France. In the same ship goes Mademoiselle Claire de 
Laval-Montmorency, young and very beautiful. When she reaches Quebec, she is 
unable to explain her purpose in coming out to that wild new country quite to the

a husband. There she finds the Sieur des Ormeaux, Adam Dollard, the commandant of Montreal. Dollard has loved her in old France; and, at this unexpected 
meeting, pursues his wooing to such good advantage that they are married at once, 
before news of the strange proceeding can reach the ears of the stern bishop. Accompanied by Claire's maid, Louise, and Bollard's servant, Jacques, who had chosen each 
other in the marriage market, Claire and Dollard go by canoe to Montreal. 

The Iroquois, the dreaded Six Nations, are moving on the settlements: there are 
two bands of them; and if these can be prevented from joining forces, New France 
may still be saved. Adam Dollard, with sixteen others, has sworn to go out and 
check them, giving and taking no quarter. Dollard, heartbroken at the pain he 
must cause Claire, and filled with remorse at having so selfishly married her and 
marred her peace when he knew the fate in store for him, starts off without telling 
her. Then, ashamed of this cowardice, he returns. She bears the news bravely, 
as becomes a daughter of the house of Montmorency, and begs to go with him. He 
cannot grant her prayer; and leaves her with the nuns of the Hotel-Dieu in Montreal. 
Claire steals out from the convent in the night, with Massawippa, an Indian girl, 
whose father, a Huron, had joined Dollard's expedition. With wonderful courage, 
they fight their way through the wilderness to the little fort which Dollard is defending. Dollard and his men hold the fort eight days against the horde of the Iroquois; 
then the fort is taken, and all perish. This is a story of heroism, simply told; the 
truth of the main incidents is vouched for in a preface by no less a historian than 
Francis Parkman.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="Romeo and Juliet" print_title="Romeo and Juliet">ROMEO AND JULIET, by Shakespeare, was first published in 1597. The plot was 
taken from a poem by Arthur Brooke, and from the prose story in Paynter's 'Palace 
of Pleasure.' The comical underplot of the servants of Capulet vs. those of Montagu; the fatal duels, the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt; the ball where Romeo, a 
Montagu, falls in love with Juliet; the impassioned love-scenes in the orchard, the 
encounter of the Nurse and Peter with the mocking gallants; the meetings at Friar 
Laurence's cell, and the marriage of Juliet there; Romeo's banishment; the attempt 
to force Juliet to marry the County Paris; the Friar's device of the sleeping-potion; 
the night scene at the tomb, Romeo first unwillingly killing Paris and then taking 
poison; the waking of Juliet, who stabs herself by her husband's body; the reconciliation of the rival families, such are the incidents in this old Italian story, which has
touched the hearts of men now for six hundred years. It is the drama of youth, "the 
first bewildered stammering interview of the heart," with the delicious passion, pure 
as dew, of first love, but love thwarted by fate and death. Sampson bites his thumb 
at a Montagu; Tybalt and Mercutio fall. Friar John is delayed; Romeo and Juliet 
die. Such is the irony of destiny. The mediasval manners at once fierce and 
polished, Benvenuto limns them. We are in the warm south: the dense gray 
dew on leaf and grass at morn, the cicada's song, the nightingale, the half-closed 
flower-cups, the drifting perfume of the orange blossom, stars burning dilated in the 
blue vault. Then the deep melancholy of the story. And yet there is a kind of 
triumph in the death of the lovers: for in four or five days they had lived an eternity; 
death made them immortal. On fire, both, with impatience, in vain the Friar warns 
them that violent delights have violent ends. Blinded by love, they only half note 
the prescience of their own souls. 'Twas written in the stars that Romeo was to be 
unlucky: at the supper he makes a mortal enemy; his interference in a duel gets 
Mercutio killed; his overhaste to poison himself leads on to Juliet's death. As for the 
garrulous old Nurse, foul-mouthed and tantalizing, she is too close to nature not to 
be a portrait from life; her advice to "marry Paris" reveals the full depth of her 
banality. Old Capulet is an Italian Squire Western, a chough of lands and houses, 
who treats this exquisite daughter just as the Squire treats Sophia. Mercutio is 
everybody's favorite: the gallant loyal gentleman, of infinite teeming fancy, in all his 
raillery not an unkind word, brave as a lion, tender-hearted as a girl, his quips and 
sparkles of wit ceasing not even when his eyes are glazing in death. </summary>
  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="Romola" print_title="Romola">ROMOLA, by George Eliot (1864). The scene of this one historic romance of the 
author is laid in Florence at the end of the fifteenth century, and its great historic 
figure is Savonarola. The civic struggle between the Medici and the French domination, the religious struggle between the dying paganism and the New Christianity, 
crowd its pages with action. The story proper follows the fortunes of Tito Melema, 
a Greek, charming, brilliant, false, his fascination of Romola, his marriage, his 
moral degradation and death. The incidents are many, the local color is rich, but 
the emphasis of the book is laid on the character of Tito. 

The working out of this is a subtle showing of the truth, that the depression of 
the moral tone by long indulgence in selfish sin is certain to culminate in some over-shadowing act of baseness. "Tito was experiencing that inexorable law of human 
souls, that we prepare ourselves for sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good or 
evil that gradually determines character." This is the key to the book, which is 
strongly ethical; but which is not the less profoundly interesting as a story. In 
Florence as in Loamshire, the lower classes are to the novelist unceasingly picturesque; 
and the talk of the crowd, in the squares and streets, full of humor and reality. In 
'Romola' appears her one attempt (in the case of Savonarola) to show a conscience 
taking upon itself great and novel responsibilities. Always studies of conscience, 
her other books depict only its pangs under the sting of the memory of slighted 
familiar obligations. Her own saying that "our deeds determine us as much as we 
determine our deeds, " is the moral lesson of Romola. </summary>
  <summary author="Barclay, Florence L. (Florence Louisa) (1862-1921)" title="The Rosary" print_title="The Rosary">ROSARY, THE, by Florence L. Barclay (1910). The scene of this story is laid in 
England and opens during the progress of a house-party at the beautiful estate of 
the Duchess of Meldrum. Among the guests are her niece Jane Champion and 
Garth Dalmain, the latter a talented young artist, rich, handsome, and well-born. 
Jane is a woman of thirty, of large physique and with very plain features of which 
she is painfully aware. She has a fine nature and is generally popular, being considered in the light of a good comrade by most of her men friends. Having an 
independent fortune she has not lacked matrimonial opportunities but has never 
been really loved. Jane has a great musical ability and a wonderful voice which 
owing to her modesty has not been heard by her friends. The Duchess who knows of 
her niece's talent asks her to fill the place of a prima-donna who was to have sung 
"The Rosary" at a large musical she has planned for her guests. Jane sings the song, 
and not only electrifies her audience but wins the heart of Garth Dalmain, who 
realizes she is the one woman in the world for him. He proposes to Jane who 
reciprocates his love, but feeling sure that his artistic taste will tire of her plain looks, 
she refuses him on the score of his youth, as he is three years her junior. Garth is 
heartbroken but devotes himself to his art, and although greatly sought after, remains true to Jane, who spends three years in travel and philanthropic work. At the 
end of this time, while sojourning in Egypt, she hears that Garth has been accidentally shot and has become blind. She hastens to him at once and nurses him back to 
health pretending that she is a stranger to him. He is struck by the similarity of his 
nurse's voice to Jane's, but she keeps up the illusion explaining that this fact had 
been frequently noted by others. After some weeks, when Jane feels convinced 
that his love for her is unshaken she again sings "The Rosary" and he at once 
recognizes her and realizes that his faithful nurse and his beloved Jane are one and 
the same. They are immediately married and enter into their happiness which had 
been achieved through so much suffering.</summary>
  <summary author="Thackeray, William Makepeace (1811-1863)" title="The Rose and the Ring" print_title="The Rose\nand\nthe Ring">ROSE AND THE RING, THE, by W. M. Thackeray (1854). In the prelude to 
'The Rose and the Ring' the author, "M. A. Titmarsh," welcomes young and old 
to what he calls a "Fireside Pantomime." The story grew out of a set of Twelfth 
Night pictures that the author was requested to make for the amusement of some 
young English people in a "foreign city," supposed to be Rome.

The story is a delightful fairy-tale, with a very quiet satire. It is essentially a 
"funny book," not a philosophy in humorous guise. 

The Rose is a magic rose belonging to Prince Bulbo, of Crim Tartary, and makes 
its possessor appear always lovable. The Ring is a fairy ring given to Prince Giglio 
of Paflagonia by his mama. It also has the property of making the wearer seem 
beautiful to all and beloved by all. 

Prince Giglio and the Princess Rosalba, of Crim Tartary, are deprived of their 
rightful thrones by their guardian uncles, who wish to place in power their own 
children, Angelica and Bulbo. Rosalba is an outcast from her own kingdom, and 
reaches the capital of Paflagonia, where she becomes maid to the lazy Angelica, 
cousin of Giglio. 

Giglio and Rosalba are the favorites of the Fairy Black Stick; although at their 
christenings she has given to each, as her best gift, a little misfortune. This fairy is 
all-powerful, as is shown by the terrible fate of old Gruff-a-Nuff, who, when he 
refused to admit the fairy to Angelica's christening, was turned into a brass knocker 
on the hall door. She never forgets Giglio and Rosalba, nor deserts them in their 
troubles; but finally brings a happy issue out of their misfortunes. This most delightful of books of its kind was illustrated by the author's own drawings, which 
interpret the story and are an essential part of it. </summary>
  <summary author="Ibsen, Henrik (1828-1906)" title="Rosmersholm" print_title="Rosmersholm">ROSMERSHOLM, by Henrik Ibsen (1886). Beata, the sickly, commonplace wife 
of the master of Rosmer, has committed suicide by drowning herself in the mill 
stream. Since her death, Rebecca West, a clever, interesting young woman, has 
been mistress of the manor and friend and companion of Rosmer, the husband. 
Rosmer is a conservative aristocrat, a retired clergyman, but inspired by Rebecca's 
ideas, he has become a freethinker in religion and radical in politics. As soon as he 
announces his change of views, he is attacked by his former friends, not by a challenge 
of his beliefs, but by scandalous insinuations in regard to the position of Rebecca in 
his household. His eyes are opened to his love for Rebecca and he asks her to marry 
him, though he now is overwhelmed by the suspicion that his unhappy wife had 
seen his interest in Rebecca, and he is thus responsible for her death. To "give 
back his innocence, " Rebecca confesses her guilt. She had known that Beata stood 
in the way of his intellectual freedom and her own ambition to make him a man of 
action and leader of men. She had influenced Beata to dwell on her childlessness. 
Finally, the hint that Rebecca is Rosmer 's mistress drives the deluded woman to 
believe it her duty to remove herself to save the ancient family name from disgrace. 
Rosmer 's faith in himself and his borrowed ideals is destroyed with his discovery of 
Rebecca as a designing adventuress. Rebecca has been ennobled by her association 
with Rosmer, and on the eve of her departure she reveals to him her unselfish devoted 
love, changed from the sensual passion which had not stopped at crime. With the 
lust for expiation and sacrifice of his former priestly ideals, he asks her to prove her 
love and restore his faith in her by doing what his wife did for him. Although resenting the superstition that claims him and kills the possibility of happiness, she consents, and together they leap into the mill-stream.</summary>
  <summary author="Twain, Mark (1835-1910)" title="Roughing It" print_title="Roughing It">ROUGHING IT, by Samuel L. Clemens (1872). Mark Twain's droll humor is 
constantly flashing out as he describes a long and eventful journey from St. Louis 
across the plains, in the early "sixties," to visit the mining camps of Nevada. He 
notes the incident of a barkeeper who was shot by an enemy, adding, "And the next 
moment he was one of the deadest men that ever lived." Interesting incidents of 
Mormon life and customs are given. Brigham Young's sage advice to an Eastern 
visitor was: "Don't incumber yourself with a large family; . . . take my word, 
friend, ten or eleven wives are all you need never go over it." Mark Twain failed 
to meet the Indian as "viewed through the mellow moonshine of romance. . . . 
It was curious to see how quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left 
him treacherous, filthy, and repulsive." Describing an absurd adventure that 
happened to his party, the author says: "We actually went into camp in a snow-drift 
in a desert, at midnight, in a storm, forlorn and helpless, within fifteen yards of a 
comfortable inn." 

He tells interesting stories of life in the mining camps, of the frenzied excitement, 
of great fortunes made and lost, of dire poverty, and of reckless extravagance; instancing a case when he refused to cross the street to receive a present of a block of 
stock, fearing he would be late to dinner. And that stock rose in value from a nominal 
sum to $70 per share within a week. 

Going to San Francisco, the author witnesses the great earthquake, of which he 
relates amusing incidents. He then goes as a reporter to the Sandwich Islands, the 
land of cannibals, missionaries, and ship captains. He does not enjoy the native 
food, poi, which too frequently used is said to produce acrid humors; "a fact," says
Twain, "that accounts for the humorous character of the Kanakas."  Obtaining a 
large stock of rich material for stories, the author returns to San Francisco, and 
acquires notoriety and wealth in the lecture field. "Thus, " said he, "after eleven 
years of vicissitudes, ended a pleasure trip to the silver mines of Nevada, which I had 
originally intended to occupy only three months. However, I usually miss my calculations further than that." The volume is a mine of the frontier slang, such as the 
author utilizes in 'Buck Fanshawe's Funeral.'</summary>
  <summary author="Thackeray, William Makepeace (1811-1863)" title="Roundabout Papers" print_title="Roundabout Papers">ROUNDABOUT PAPERS, THE, by William Makepeace Thackeray. Thackeray 
undertook the editorship of the Cornhill Magazine; in the year 1859. 'The Roundabout Papers' were sketches for the magazine, coming out simultaneously, between 
1859 and 1863, with 'Lovel the Widower' and 'The Adventures of Philip.' They 
represent Thackeray's best qualities as an essayist, and cover a wide range of subjects. 
Some of the titles are: 'On Two Children in Black,' 'On Screens in Dining-Rooms,' 
On Some Late Great Victories,' 'On a Hundred Years Hence,' and 'A Mississippi 
Bubble.' One of the papers, 'The Notch on the Axe,' displays the author's peculiar 
genius for burlesque story-telling. It is a dream of the guillotine, occasioned by his 
grandmother's snuff-box and a sensational novel. The essay 'On a Joke I Once 
Heard from the Late Thomas Hood' is a cordial tribute to that poet's memory, and 
in it the joke is not repeated. One of the most noteworthy of the papers is called' On 
Thorns in the Cushion.' The task of editing a magazine was irksome to Thackeray's 
kindly and sensitive nature. "What, then," he writes, "is the main grief you spoke 
of as annoying you, the toothache in the Lord Mayor's jaw, the thorn in the 
cushion of the editorial chair? It is there. Ah! it stings me now as I write. It 
conies with almost every morning's post. . . . They don't sting quite so sharply as 
they did, but a skin is a skin, and they bite, after all, most wickedly. . . . Ah me! 
we wound where we never intended to strike; we create anger where we never meant 
harm, and these thoughts are the thorns in our cushion." Thackeray, in fact, resigned the position of editor in 1862, though he continued to write for the magazine 
as long as he lived.</summary>

1879. It was the first of the author's books to establish for him a wide reputation. 
A slight thread of story suffices to connect a series of humorous episodes which result 
from the efforts of a young couple Euphemia, and her husband who tells the story 
in the first person to establish themselves in a summer home at once desirable and 
inexpensive. They hit upon the plan of securing an old canal-boat, which they fit 
up and name Rudder Grange. The droll sayings and original doings of Pomona, the 
servant; the courting of Jonas, her lover; the unique experiences of the boarder; the 
distresses of Euphemia and her husband, are told in a manner which is irresistibly 
funny. The same characters reappear in several of Mr. Stockton's later stories, the 
longest of which is 'Pomona's Travels.'</summary>
  <summary author="Volney, C.-F. (Constantin-François) (1757-1820)" title="The Ruins" print_title="The Ruins">RUINS, THE, by Constantin Frangois Volney. These meditations upon the revolutions of 
empires were published in Paris in 1791, and have for their theme the thought that 
all the ills of man are traceable to his abandonment of Natural Religion. The author, 
who was an extensive traveler, represents himself as sitting on the ruins of Palmyra, 
dreaming of the past, and wondering why the curse of God rests on this land. He 
hears a voice (the Genius of the Tombs), complaining of the injustice of men, in 
attributing to God's vengeance that which is due to their own folly. Love of self, 
desire of well-being, and aversion to pain, are the primordial laws of nature. By 
these laws men were driven to associate. Ignorance and cupidity raised the strong 
against the weak. The feeble joined forces, obliging the strong to do likewise. To 
prevent strife, equitable laws were passed. Paternal despotism was the foundation 
of that of the State. Tiring of the abuses of many petty rulers, the nation gave itself 
one head. Cupidity engendered tyranny, and all the revenues of the nation were 
used for the private expenses of the monarch. Under pretext of religion, millions of 
men were employed in useless works. Luxury became a source of corruption. 
Excessive taxation obliged the small landholder to abandon his field, and the riches
and lands were concentrated in few hands. The ignorant and poor attributed their 
calamities to some superior power, while the priests attributed them to wicked gods. 
To appease them, man sacrificed his pleasures. Mistaking his pleasures for crimes, 
and suffering for expiation, he abjured love of self and detested life; but as nature 
has endowed the heart of man with hope, he formed, in his imagination, another 
country. For chimerical hopes he neglected the reality. Life was but a fatiguing 
voyage, a painful dream, the body a prison. Then a sacred laziness established itself 
in the world. The fields were deserted, empires depopulated, monuments neglected; 
and ignorance, superstition, and fanaticism, joining their forces, multiplied the devastation and ruins. The Genius shows him a revolution, where Liberty, Justice, 
and Equality are recognized as the foundation of society. Before accepting a religion, 
all are invited to present their claims for recognition. The result is not only dissensions among the different religions, but between the different branches of the same 
religion, each one claiming that his is the only revealed religion and that all the others 
are impositions.</summary>
  <summary author="Cobbett, William (1763-1835)" title="Rural Rides" print_title="Rural Rides">RURAL RIDES, by William Cobbett (1830). 'Rural Rides' consists of the accounts 
of a series of political tours on horseback which Cobbett took through many English 
counties for some years before 1830. His impressions were published regularly in his 
paper the "Political Register," which enjoyed a huge circulation and exercised 
immense influence. Published in collected form under the present title, they form 
an extraordinarily vivid picture of the social and domestic life in the agricultural 
England of Cobbett's day. The modern student is not so much concerned with the 
fact that Cobbett was the foremost journalist in the struggle for parliamentary 
reform, as with his shrewdness, his homely eloquence, his independence of thought, 
with which was combined a perfectly sincere interest in the welfare of the poor, 
especially of the agricultural laborer, whose condition at that time and indeed for 
generations afterwards was a scandal to England. The book is not only remarkable 
as a vivid picture of the life of certain strata of society at a particular epoch, but from 
the literary point of view, its descriptions of rural scenery are in many ways unsurpassed, and it is one of the best examples of the use of terse, vigorous, direct, and 
unadorned Anglo-Saxon which the language has to show. In this case the style is, 
indeed, the man, fearless, pugnacious, homely, in every line breathing the love of his 
fellow-men and a consuming hatred of oppression.</summary>
  <summary author="Flaubert, Gustave (1821-1880)" title="Salammbo" print_title="Salammbo">SALAMMBO, by Gustave Flaubert (1864). This historical romance was the fruit 
of Flaubert's visit to the ruins of old Carthage, and is a kind of revivification of the 
ancient capital and its people. The scenes testify to the great erudition of the 
author, but critics complain that the picture has too little perspective. All is painted 
with equal brilliance matter essential and unessential. 

The sacred garment of Tanit is made the object around which the action revolves; 
and the fate of Carthage is bound up in the preservation of this vestment within her 
walls. The central point of the story is the boundless passion of Matho, a common 
soldier among the mercenaries, for Salammbo, the beautiful daughter of the great 
Hamilcar; and the fate of the vestment of Tanit continually overshadows the fate 
of his love. By a mad act of daring, he gets possession of the carefully guarded 
treasure, and through its influence on the popular mind, heads a rising of the troops, 
who proceed against Carthage. Urged on by the High Priest, Salammb6 is persuaded 
that it is her sacred duty to recover the stolen vestment, and so bring back the protection of the goddess to the arms of Carthage. Under his instruction, she is led 
secretly by night to the tent of Matho to obtain the vestment. Obedient to the 
pontiff, she endures the soldier's wild transports of joy, and succeeds in carrying away 
thee vestment, which, in his self-forgetting adoration he has wrapped about her.

Fortune returns to the Carthaginians, the rebellious leader is taken, and Salammbo's 
wedding to the man of her father's choice is made the scene of Matho's martyrdom. 
Looking down at the torn and dying man, whose eyes alone retain the semblance of 
humanity, Salammbo suddenly recalls the tender babble of those agonized lips, the 
adoration of those eyes on that night in his tent. She realizes what this man has 
suffered for love of her, and her heart breaks. In the act of drinking the wine her 
bridegroom offers, she sinks back dead. And thus the two beings whose touch has 
profaned the garment of Tanit pass from the earth. The most brilliant of romances 
dealing with the classic world, this story holds its place through all variations of 
popular taste, among the masterpieces of fiction.</summary>

of the most entertaining productions of a writer who excels in delicate comedy, and 
has given readers an agreeable change from the typical "French novel"; though it 
has little substance or thought. The action occurs during the year 1875, in Switzerland and France. Samuel Brohl, a youth of lowest origin, is bought by Princess 
Gulof, who educates him, and then makes him nominally her secretary. He tires 
of her jealous tyranny and runs away, assuming the name and history of Count 
Larinski. Antoinette Moriaz, an heiress of romantic notions, who undervalues the 
love of honest Camille Langis because "there is no mystery about him," supposing 
Samuel to be the Polish hero he impersonates, thinks she has found the man she 
wants at last. Madame de Lorcy, her godmother and Camille's aunt, suspects 
"Count Larinski" of being an adventurer; and is finally helped to prove it by the 
Princess, Samuel's former mistress, who recounts to Antoinette how she bought him 
of his father for a bracelet, which bracelet Samuel has given the girl as a betrothal
gift. Disillusionized, she breaks with Samuel, saying pathetically, "The man I 
loved was he whose history you related to me" (i. e., Count Larinski). Camille visits 
Samuel to get back Antoinette's letters and gifts, contemptuously refuses a challenge, 
and buys the keepsakes for 25,000 francs. The bargain concluded, Samuel theatrically 
thrusts the bank-notes into a candle flame, and repeats his challenge. In the resulting 
duel, Camille is left for dead by Samuel, that picturesque scamp fleeing to America. 
Camille recovers, and eventually his devotion to Antoinette meets its due reward.</summary>

Merton has afforded entertainment and instruction to many generations of boys 
since its first publication about 1780. Portraying the social ideas of the English of 
more than a hundred years ago, it can hardly be regarded, in the present day, as 
exerting a wholesome influence, in fact, it is chiefly remarkable for its tone of 
unutterable priggishness. 

Master Tommy Merton in this story is the son (aged six) of a wealthy gentleman 
who dwells chiefly in the island of Jamaica. Tommy's short life has been spent in 
luxury, with the result that he has become an unmitigated nuisance. Harry Sandford, on the contrary, though the son of a poor farmer, was even at an early age 
replete with every virtue; and when the two boys are placed under the instruction of 
a Mr. Barlow, an exceptionally wise and good clergyman, he is continually used as an 
example to the reprehensible Tommy. Morals are tediously drawn from every
incident of their daily lives, and from the stories which they read in their lesson 
books. 'The Gentleman and the Basket-Maker'; 'Androcles and the Lion'; 'History of a Surprising Cure of the Gout,' and other stories of a like nature, form the 
food on which these young intellects are nourished. 

Not the least remarkable feature of the book is the polished language used by 
these children of six years of age; and this juvenile can now only be regarded as an 
excellent example of the literature with which our grandfathers and great-grand-fathers were regaled in their youth.</summary>

history of clothes: they are co-existent with civilization, and are the source of all 
social and political distinction. Aprons, for example, are of all sorts, from the 
smith's iron sheet to the bishop's useless drapery. The future church is shown in the 
paper aprons of the Paris cooks; future historians will talk, not of church, but of 
journalism, and of editors instead of statesmen. Man is apt to forget that he is not a 
mere clothed animal, that to the eye of pure reason he is a soul. StiU Teufelsdrockh does not counsel a return to the natural state, for he recognizes the utility of 
clothes as the foundation of society. Wonder, at himself or at nature, every man 
must feel in order to worship. Everything material is but an emblem of something 
spiritual; clothes are such emblems, and are thus worthy of examination. 

The autobiographic details sent to the editor which fill Book ii. came to him on 
loose scraps of paper in sealed paper bags, with no attempt at arrangement anywhere. 
A mysterious stranger left Teufelsdrockh, when he was a helpless infant, at the house 
of Andreas Futteral, a veteran and farmer. Andreas and his wife Gretchen brought 
the boy up honestly and carefully. As a child he roamed out-doors, listened to the 
talk of old men, and watched the sunset light play over the valley. At school he 
learned little, and at the gymnasiums less. At the university he received no instruction, but happened to prefer reading to rioting, and so gained a great deal of information. Then he was thrust into the world to find out what his capability was by himself. He withdrew from the law, in which he had begun, and tried to start out for 
bimseJf . The woman whom he loved married another, and he was plunged into the
depths of despair. Doubt, which he had felt in the university, became unbelief in 
God and even the Devil, in everything but duty, could he have known what duty 
was. He was a victim to a curious fear, until one day his whole spirit rose, and 
uttering the protest of the "everlasting yea, " asserted its own freedom. Life came 
to mean freedom to him , he felt impelled to "look through the shows of things to the 
things themselves, " to find the Ideal in the midst of the Actual. 

The third book, which deals with the philosophy itself, is much less continuous 
and clear. In the first chapter, he praises George Fox's suit of leather as the most 
remarkable suit of its century, since it was a symbol of the equality of man and of the 
freedom of thought. Religion is the basis of society: every society may be described 
as a church which is audibly preaching or prophesying, or which is not yet articulate, 
or which is dumb with old age. Religion has entirely abandoned the clothes provided for her by modern society, and sits apart making herself new ones. All symbols 
are valuable as keeping something silent, and, at the same time, as revealing something of the Infinite. Society now has no proper symbols, owing to over-utilitarianism and over-independence. Still a new society is forming itself to rise, Phoenix-like, 
from the ashes of the old. Mankind, like nature, is one, not an aggregate of units. 
The future church for the worship of these mysteries will be literature, as already 
suggested by the prophet Goethe. Custom makes nature, time, and space, which 
are really miracles, seem natural, but we must feel wonder and reverence at them. 
Our life is through mystery to mystery, from God to God. The chief points, in 
concluding, to be remembered are: All life is based on wonder; all clothes, or symbols, 
are forms or manifestations of the spiritual or infinite; cant and hypocrisy everywhere 
should be replaced by clear truth. 

The book is written in Carlyle's most characteristic style and contains remarkable 
passages of romantic autobiography.</summary>
  <summary author="Hawthorne, Nathaniel (1804-1864)" title="The Scarlet Letter" print_title="The Scarlet Letter">SCARLET LETTER, THE, the novel which established Nathaniel Hawthorne's 
fame, and which he wrote in the ancient environment of Salem, was published in 
1850, when he was forty-six years old. Its simple plot of Puritan times in New
England is surrounded with an air of mystery and of weird imaginings. The scene 
is in Boston, two hundred years ago: the chief characters are Hester Prynne; her 
lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, ths young but revered minister of the town; their child, 
Pearl; and her husband Roger Chillingworth, an aged scholar, a former resident of 
Amsterdam, who, resolving to remove to the New World, had, two years previously, 
sent his young wife Hester on before him. When the book opens, he arrives in Boston, 
to find her upon the pillory, her babe in her arms; upon her breast the Scarlet Letter 
"A" ("Adulteress"), which she has been condemned to wear for life. She refuses to 
reveal the name of her partner in guilt, and takes up her lonely abode on the edge of 
the wilderness. Here Pearl grows up a wild elf-like child; here Hester makes atonement by devoting her life to deeds of mercy. Her husband, whose identity she has 
sworn to conceal, remains in the town, and in the guise of a physician, pries into and 
tortures the minister's remorse-haunted soul. Hester, knowing this, forgetting aught 
but love, proposes flight with him. He wills to remain, to reveal his guilt publicly. 
Confessing all, after a sermon of great power, he dies in Hester's arms, upon the 
platform where she once stood condemned. A wonderful atmosphere of the Puritan 
society bathes this book, its moral intensity, its sensitiveness to the unseen powers; 
while forever pressing in upon the seething little community is the mystery of the 
new-world wilderness, the counterpart of the spiritual wilderness in which Hester 
and Arthur wander. This great creation is one of the few "classics" that the nineteenth century has added to literature.</summary>

The aim of this, one of the latest and ablest of Schiller biographies is to interpret the 
works of the poet "as the expression of an interesting individuality and an interesting 
epoch," to see the man as he was and to understand the national temperament to 
which he endeared himself. At Ludwigsburg in Wurtemberg Schiller "got his first 
childish impressions of the great world: of sovereignty exercised that a few might strut 
in gay plumage while the many toiled to keep them in funds; of state policies determined by wretched court intrigues; of natural rights trampled upon at the caprice of 
a prince or a prince's favorite." Partly educated at the Karlschule at Ludwigsburg, 
an institution founded to gratify a fad of Duke Karl, and intended to serve as a 
training-ground for future servants of the state for at least part of his time at 
school he got the reputation of a dullard. But his poetic powers were ripening, and 
first took shape in an important work in 'The Robbers' (1780) which was read 
secretly to a knot of admiring school-mates. The success of this play, one of the most 
significant of the eighteenth century, led Schiller on to other and still more successful 
efforts in drama 'Fiesco' and 'Cabal and Love.'  The most prolific period of his 
literary life was the time of his close association with Goethe at Weimar from 1794 
until Schiller's death in 1805. The verdict of this biographer is that while Schiller 
lacked the supreme qualities of a great world-poet, he was great as a man, and his 
life of passionate striving for the ideal is a splendid model for all intellectual work.</summary>

masterpiece 'The School for Scandal' narrowly escaped suppression as a license to 
perform it was refused, and it was only through the author's personal influence with 
the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Hertford, that the license was granted on the very day 
fixed for its performance. "It is," says Hazlitt, "if not the most original, perhaps the 
most finished and faultless comedy which we have." It is also the wittiest and most 
deadly attack that has ever been made in English on the organized hypocrisy of 
society. Joseph and Charles Surface present the contrast between shameless hypocrisy and reckless good-nature. Sir Peter Teazle, the most miserable dog ever since 
six months previously Lady Teazle made him the happiest of men, and his perpetual 
squabbles with his young wife: the scandal scene in which Sir Benjamin Backbite, 
Lady Sneerwell, and Mrs. Candour strike "a character dead at every word"; the 
scene in which Charles sells all the family pictures but those of his uncle who is the 
purchaser in disguise; and the discovery that it is Lady Teazle and not a little French 
milliner who is behind the screen are so familiar as to have become household words; 
and the play is as popular on the stage as ever. It is said that 'The Rivals' was 
prepared in great haste in response to stimulus from the company who were to play it, 
and that when it was completed the author wrote on the last page: "Finished at last, 
Thank God! R. B. Sheridan." To which one anxious official added: "Amen! W.

  <summary author="Porter, Jane (1776-1850)" title="The Scottish Chiefs" print_title="The Scottish Chiefs">SCOTTISH CHIEFS, THE, by Jane Porter. This spirited historical romance was 
first published in 1809, and has enjoyed unceasing popularity. It gives many 
pictures of the true knightly chivalry dear to boyish hearts, and is historically correct 
in all important points. The narrative opens in 1296 with the murder of Wallace's 
wife by the English soldiery, and shows how, fired by this outrage, he tried to rouse 
his country against the tyrant Edward. He gathers about him commons and nobles, 
and gains especial favor with venerable Lord Mar. Lady Mar is impressed by his 
beauty; and when he scorns her dishonorable passion, she proves his worst enemy, 
and incites the nobles to treason. He also wins the heart of the lovely Helen Mar, 
who respects his devotion to his dead wife, and does not aspire to be more than his 
sister. Wallace effects the capture of the castles of Dumbarton, Berwick, and Stirling, 
and fights the bloody battles of Stanmore and Falkirk. But as soon as he becomes 
prominent, petty jealousies spring up among the nobles; and when in spite of his 
inferior birth he is appointed regent, their rage knows no bounds. He has continually 
to guard against treachery within as well as foes without, but his intrepid spirit never 
fails. He goes in the disguise of a harper to the court of Edward, and rouses young 
Bruce to escape and embrace his country's cause. Bruce and Wallace go to France 
to rescue the abducted Helen Mar, and while there meet Baliol, whom Edward had 
once adjudged king of Scotland. On returning to his own country Wallace finds the 
English in possession of much of the territory he had wrested from them, and by a 
series of vigorous movements regains the mastery. But internal feuds and jealousies 
are too strong for him, and on Edward's second invasion Wallace is abandoned by 
his supporters. He flees and long eludes his pursuers, but is finally betrayed, taken 
to London, and brutally hanged and quartered. But the fire that he had kindled 
did not altogether die out, and Edward was obliged to treat Scotland with respect 
even after he had murdered her hero.</summary>

under most brutal and revolting conditions. The hero and narrator of this tale is 
Humphrey Van Weyden, a literary critic and a man of leisure, who is wrecked in a 
fog while crossing San Francisco Bay in a ferry boat. He is carried out to sea and is
picked up by a sealing-schooner named the "Ghost," which is outward bound. 
The captain, "Wolf Larsen," so called on account of his fiendish cruelty and furious 
outbursts of temper, refuses to put Humphrey ashore and forces upon him the duties 
of cabin-boy. Van Weyden is robbed and abused by Mugridge, the cook, but obtains no satisfaction from the captain, who is a curious mixture of brutality and self-culture, and amuses himself by discussing life and literature with Humphrey when 
he is not tormenting him physically. On various occasions the crew, driven to desperation by the brutal treatment they have received from the Sea Wolf, endeavor to 
take his life, but each time are foiled by his indomitable strength with dire results to 
the leading conspirators. A beautiful girl named Maude Brewster who has been 
wrecked at sea is rescued by the "Ghost" and both Humphrey and the Sea- Wolf are 
captivated by her. This is a dangerous complication, and leads to many trying 
situations in which Humphrey finds himself in danger of the Sea Wolf's vengeance. 
Finally the "Ghost" is wrecked and Humphrey and Maud get away in a small boat 
and reach a desert island where they manage to exist for some time. The hulk of 
the ship is washed ashore, its only occupant being the Sea Wolf, who has become blind 
and helpless and has been deserted by all his men. Humphrey and Maud endeavor 
to make repairs on the damaged vessel in the hopes of thereby getting away from the 
island, but Larsen whose ugly nature is unchanged tries in every way to frustrate 
their efforts. He tries to kill Humphrey but does not succeed and soon becomes 
paralyzed as well as blind. His companions tend him until the hour of his death, 
which finds him unsoftened. The lovers who have endured such terrible hardships 
are finally rescued by a revenue cutter and their sufferings are over.</summary>

Wilde were the earliest of the later nineteenth-century dramatists who attempted 
to do for England what Ibsen had done. Boldness in treating actual problems of 
every-day life went with an equally bold use of modern stagecraft. Aubrey Tanqueray, a well-preserved and handsome widower of forty-two informs his old friends 
Misquith and Jayne, both men of the world and older than himself, that he is about 
to marry again, but refrains from telling them the lady's name. Paula (the second 
Mrs. Tanqueray), a beautiful, fresh, innocent-looking young woman of twenty-seven 
(who nevertheless has had a past), is cold-shouldered by some of Aubrey's former 
society lady friends. He married her in the honest belief that if he were kind to her 
(as her former male acquaintances had not been) she would be a reclaimed woman. 
She speedily finds her position unbearable, because she is ignored by local society, 
and also because she is unable to win the affection or confidence of Ellean, a young 
girl of nineteen, a daughter of Aubrey's by his first marriage. He himself is unwilling 
that the second Mrs. Tanqueray should be the mentor of his daughter, and gives his 
consent to Ellean's going to Paris with Mrs. Cortelyou. In Paris Ellean meets and 
becomes engaged to Captain Ardale, who had formerly been intimate with Paula. 
Paula feels it to be her duty to inform Aubrey of their relationship. He forbids 
Ellean to see Captain Ardale again. Ellean now admits that from the first meeting 
she had guessed what sort of woman Paula was. Paula in wild despair, though Aubrey 
offered to go away and start a new life with her elsewhere, killed herself. "Killed 
herself? Yes. Yes. So everybody will say. But I know I helped to kill her. If 
I'd only been merciful!" says Ellean in the concluding words of the play.</summary>

popularity down to the present. It was the second of a series of similar works. 

'Self-Help* is a stimulating book for young people, written in an interesting 
manner; and while full of religious feeling, is free from cant. The tenor of the work 
may be judged by a quotation from the opening chapter: "The spirit of self-help is 
the root of all genuine growth in the individual; and, exhibited in the lives of many, it 
constitutes the true source of national vigor and strength. Help from without is 
often enfeebling in its effects, but help from within invariably invigorates." The 
book abounds in anecdotes of celebrated men, inventors, scientists, artists, soldiers, clergymen, and statesmen: Minton and Wedgewood the potters; Arkwright 
Watts, and Peel; Davy, Faraday, Herschel, and many others, among scientists; 
Reynolds, Michael Angelo, Haydn, Bach, Beethoven, and others in the arts; Napoleon, Wellington, Napier, Livingstone, as examples of energy and courage. The 
various chapters dwell upon National and Individual Self-Help; Application and 
Perseverance; Helps and Opportunities; Industry, Energy, and Courage; Business 
Qualities; Money, its Use and Abuse; Self-Culture; and Character. </summary>
  <summary author="Kennedy, Charles Rann (1871-1950)" title="The Servant in the House" print_title="The Servant\nin the House">SERVANT IN THE HOUSE, THE, by Charles Kennedy (1907). The theme of this 
symbolic drama is the brotherhood of man. The vicar has appealed for funds to 
rebuild his crumbling church. His brother, the Bishop of Benares, whom he has not 
seen for many years, has promised to help him. His wife has succeeded in interesting 
her worldly brother the Bishop of London in the plan, because he believes that the 
name of the Bishop of Benares, who is famous for his piety and good works, will bring 
in millions, which the ambitious prelate wishes to divert to his chief interest in life, 
the Society for the Promotion and Preservation of Emoluments for the Higher Clergy. 
Both bishops are expected on the same morning. The vicar has another brother, 
Robert, who is a drunkard, disowned by the family. The childless vicar and his wife 
have adopted Robert's daughter Mary, who has never known her father. The vicar's 
conscience tells him that he is a hypocrite to preach the spirit of brotherhood in his 
pulpit and refuse to help his own disreputable brother, who has become a scavenger. 
His worldly wife feels that Robert has only his deserts and opposes her husband's 
wish to gain peace of mind by receiving Robert at the vicarage. Into this troubled 
household comes the Bishop of Benares, disguised as Manson, the new butler. When 
Robert, rough, uncouth, cursing at the injustice of the world, comes to claim his 
daughter, Manson quiets him, so that he hides his identity from Mary to save her 
dream of a father, brave and beautiful and good. The Bishop of London arrives, and 
with physical and spiritual blindness and deafness combined, mistakes Robert for the 
vicar, and reveals his own hypocrisy to Manson. Through Manson's influence, Mary 
is led to think about her father and ask the vicar about him, and in spite of his wife 
he tells her the truth. Robert, whose business is drains, has gone under the foundations of the church to find the source of corruption, a vault under the very pulpit, 
symbolizing the dead body of tradition and convention which poisons those who 
would worship God in spirit and in truth. He sets about the work of cleaning it out 
in such brave spirit that his daughter recognizes him as her dream came true, and his 
brother throws off his clerical coat to work with him. Manson orders the pompous
Bishop of London, the servant of Mammon, out of the house, and reveals himself to 
his brothers. The character of Manson is a replica of Jesus Christ. It is suggested 
that he may be the Messiah. His presence brings truth and harmony into the tangled 
lives of the vicar's household. </summary>
  <summary author="Ruskin, John (1819-1900)" title="The Seven Lamps of Architecture" print_title="The Seven Lamps\nof\nArchitecture">SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE. The 'Seven Lamps of Architecture' by 
John Ruskin appeared in 1847. In this book architecture is regarded as the revealing medium, or lamp, through which flame a people's passions, and which embodies their life, history, and religious faith, in temple, palace, and home. 

The first Lamp is "Sacrifice," or the offering of precious things because they are 
precious, rather than because they are useful or necessary. Such a spirit picks 
out the most costly marble or the most elaborate ornamentation simply because 
it is most costly or most elaborate, and is directly opposed to the prevalent feeling of 
modern times which desires to produce the largest result at the least cost. 

Next comes the "Lamp of Truth," or the spirit of reality and sincerity characteristic of all noble schools of architecture. Ruskin here condemns all falsity of 
assertion in architectual construction, in material, in quantity of labor, and in the 
substitution of effect for veracity, and traces the downfall of art in Europe to the 
substitution of line for mass, and of mere expression in place of the general principles of truth. 

The third and fourth Lamps are those of "Power" and "Beauty, " or the expression in architecture of the sublime and the delightful; the sublime, indicating man's 
power to govern; the delightful, man's power to gather. The former ability shows 
itself in form, situation, and line, and the latter in ornamentation.

Then follows the "Lamp of Life," which is the spirit of originality that seizes 
upon substances, alike in use and outward form, and endows them with its own 
energy, passion, and nobility, until rough stones come to life. This spirit of Life is 
distinguished from the spirit of death by its power to animate. The spirit of death 
may act and imitate, but it is powerless to inspire. 

The last two Lamps are those of "Memory" and "Obedience"; the one ever 
burning brightly and steadily among those peoples who reverence the past, and 
flaming forth in buildings erected to commemorate national achievements; while 
the other, the "Lamp of Obedience," reveals strict conformity in architecture to its 
laws, which should be no more disregarded than the laws which govern religion, 
politics, or social relations. 

Ruskin affirms that "the architecture of a nation is great only when it is as universal and established as its language, and when provincial differences in style are 
nothing more than so many dialects." </summary>

death, the horror and iniquity of capital punishment, is the theme of this powerful 
study of the character, thoughts, and feelings of men and women condemned to die. 
Five of the prisoners are revolutionists who have attempted to assassinate a high 
official in Russia, two are common peasant murderers. They wait in solitary confinement for seventeen days after the judgment, and are finally summoned to ride 
in the dark to midnight execution. The young soldier, Sergey, fights successfully 
the fear of death that takes possession of his sound strong body, but he is tortured 
with dread of the farewell visit from his stricken father and mother. The strong 
characters, Werner, the leader of the terrorists, and the young girl, Musya, are able 
to bear the thought of inevitable death, he with enlightened mind, and she by her 
innocent purity and conception of immortal life. Musya goes to the scaffold supporting the ignorant terrified murderer with her beautiful courage and humanity. 
The author aims through his art to destroy the "barriers which separate one soul 
from another," and helps us to realize sympathetically the humanity of even the 
lowest criminal.</summary>

book would appear to be that which was said (by one of them) to have animated the 
contributors to the English Dictionary of National Biography: "no flowers, by request." The purpose of the writer has been to provide a book which "shall supply 
within a brief compass an exhaustive and well-arranged statement of the facts of 
Shakespeare's career, achievement, and reputation, that shall reduce conjecture to 
the smallest dimensions consistent with coherence, and shall give verifiable references 
to all the original sources of information." By common consent he has abundantly 
succeeded in this aim. He traces the parentage, childhood and education of the poet; 
his early days at Stratford and first appearances as an actor on the London stage; the 
first dramatic efforts which, notwithstanding the poet's unique originality and fertility 
of invention, took the form of adapting familiar Ovidian fables for English readers; 
his amazing fluency of composition, which made Ben Jonson say of him that "whatsoever he penned he never blotted out a line," The whole of Shakespeare's dramatic
work was probably begtm and ended between his twenty-seventh and forty-seventh 
year. The student of human nature will also notice that his noblest literary efforts 
during the latter portion of these years coincide with certain shrewd business transactions which re-established him as a man of property in his native Stratford, where 
he spent his concluding days. An extraordinary variety of information is conveyed 
not only in the chapters which deal with Shakespeare's life and works, but in the 
sections which deal with autographs, portraits and memorials, bibliography, and the 
poet's posthumous reputation. As a perfect example of the terse, restrained, and 
judicial criticism of the true scholar, students should note the chapter (only two pages 
in length) in which Sir Sidney Lee attempts a general estimate of the poet, and which 
thus begins and ends. "In knowledge of human character, in wealth of humour, in 
depth of passion, in fertility of fancy, and in soundness of judgment, he has no rival. 
... To Shakespeare the intellect of the world, speaking in divers accents, applies 
with one accord his own words: 'How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in 
apprehension how like a god!'" The new edition of 1911 contains a great deal of 
additional matter, based largely on recent researches into the history of the theatre 
and theatrical companies of Shakespeare's time.</summary>

Mr. Haggard has pictured his hero as going to Africa to avenge the death of an Egyptian ancestor, whose strange history has been handed down to him in an old manuscript 
which he discovers. His ancestor, a priest of Isis, had been slain by an immortal 
white sorceress, somewhere in Africa; and in the ancient record his descendants are 
exhorted to revenge his death. The sorceress, no other than "She," is discovered 
in a remarkable country peopled by marvelous beings, who, as true servants of the 
sorceress, present an exaggerated picture of the barbaric rites and cruelties of Africa. 
To this strange land comes the handsome and passionate Englishman, with two companions who share his many thrilling experiences. A mysterious bond exists between 
the young Englishman and the sorceress: the memory of the ancient crime and the 
expectation of its atonement. The climax of the story is reached when the travelers 
and the sorceress together visit the place where the mysterious fire burns which gives
thousands of years of life, loveliness, strength, and wisdom, or else swift death. 
"She" for the second time dares to pass into the awful flame, and so meet her doom, 
being instantly consumed. The weird tale does not lack a fitting background for 
its scenes of adventure, the author choosing an extinct volcano for the scene of the 
tragedy; so vast is its crater that it contains a great city, while its walls are full of 
caves containing the marvelously preserved dead of a prehistoric people. Haggard's 
practical knowledge and experience of savage life and wild lands, his sense of the charm 
of ruined civilization, his appreciation of sport, and his faculty of imparting an aspect 
of truth to impossible adventures, find ample expression in this entertaining and 
wholly impossible tale.</summary>

words of Dr. Johnson, "the great end of comedy, making an audience merry," and 
it has been making audiences merry ever since. Hardcastle who loves "everything 
that's old: old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine" (but whose wife 
objects to being put in the category of old things which her husband loves); Mrs. 
Hardcastle, who spoils their son, Tony, a constant frequenter of "The Three Jolly 
Pigeons"; and Miss Hardcastle, whom her father wishes to marry to young Mario W, 
"one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world, " have all taken 
their places among the best beloved characters on the comic stage. The idle yet 
mischievous, cunning yet stupid Tony Lumpkin, with his associates at "The Three 
Pigeons" one of whom is a showman who declares that his bear dances to none but 
the genteelest of tunes, is another unforgettable character. One of the most ably conceived figures in the book is young Marlow, whose bashfulness in the presence 
of Miss Hardcastle and freedom when in the company of the supposed maid-servant 
who was really Miss Hardcastle in disguise, combine to make up a remarkable piece 
of character-drawing.</summary>

goodly proportion deal with the great writers of America. One volume, the sixth, 
is devoted to great religious thinkers among them Saint Augustine, Pascal, 
Bunyan, and Plato who are grouped under the sub-title, 'Studies of Religious 
Dualism.' The author is a stimulating and suggestive critic, who emphasizes particularly the necessity of a revival of classicism in an age of romantic disintegration. </summary>
  <summary author="Howard, Bronson (1842-1908)" title="Shenandoah" print_title="Shenandoah">SHENANDOAH, by Bronson Howard (1888). A military drama of the Civil War. 
The first scene is a Southern home in Charleston in the early morning hours after a 
ball. Lieutenant Kerchival West, a Northern officer, is making a declaration of love 
to Gertrude Ellingham, a Southern girl. As he awaits her answer the first shot is
fired by the Confederates upon Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, beginning the 
war which makes the North and South enemies, and he accepts his dismissal. The 
second and third acts take place at the Ellingham homestead in the Shenandoah 
valley. Gertrude Ellingham is captured and brought a prisoner before Lieutenant 
West just after she has succeeded in carrying dispatches to Thornton in the Confederate lines. Thornton, the villain of the piece, is also captured later. Lieutenant 
West had fought a duel with him for insulting his colonel's wife, Mrs. Haverhill, with 
his attentions. Thornton springs at Lieutenant West, wounding him seriously. He 
accuses the unconscious man to Colonel Haverhill of being Mrs. HaverhilTs lover, 
Gertrude, forgetting her devotion to the South, kneels beside West, confessing her 
love. Colonel HaverhilFs son, Frank, has led a wild life, and has been disowned by 
his father. He joins the army under an assumed name, and accepts from his father, 
as commander, the dangerous mission of going through the enemy's lines to get the 
signal code of the Confederates. He captures the code, but is mortally wounded. 
His father attends the funeral, doing honor to his bravery, not knowing the young 
officer was his own son. There is a thrilling scene when the Union army is in retreat, 
and General Sheridan rides to the rescue turning the retreat to victory. The last 
act is in Washington after Lee's surrender. A long delayed letter written by his 
dead son explains to Colonel Haverhill how the miniature of his wife had come into 
Lieutenant West's possession. All the various lovers are reunited. </summary>
  <summary author="Doyle, Arthur Conan (1859-1930)" title="The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" print_title="The Adventures\nof\nSherlock Holmes">SHERLOCK HOLMES, ADVENTURES OF, by Sir A. Conan Doyle (1892), consists of twelve sketches, purporting to have been recorded by Dr. Watson, a friend 
and coadjutor of Sherlock Holmes. In each narrative Holmes figures as a scientific 
amateur detective of remarkable skill, unraveling the most intricate criminal snarls. 
Enslaved to cocaine, eccentric, brusque, he nevertheless is a patient and untiring 
student, having developed his penetrative faculties to an amazing degree. His forte 
is a posteriori reasoning, which enables him so to group apparently unimportant 
effects as to uncover the most remote and disconnected causes. As an analytical 
chemist he classifies many varieties of cigar ashes, mud, dust, and the like; collates 
endless data, and constructs chains of evidence with a swift accuracy which results 
in the apprehension and conviction of criminals only less gifted than himself. The 
sketches are: 'A Study in Scarlet'; 'A Scandal in Bohemia'; 'The Red-Headed 
League' (given in this LIBRARY); 'A Case of Identity'; 'The Boscome Valley Mystery'; 'The Five Orange Pips'; 'The Man with the Twisted Lip'; 'The Blue Carbuncle'; 'The Speckled Band'; 'The Engineer's Thumb'; 'The Noble Bachelor'; 
'The Beryl Coronet'; and 'The Copper Beeches.' All are full of bizarre and often 
of grewsome details, and all are unrivaled as specimens of constructive reasoning 
applied to every-day life. Sir Conan Doyle was still writing the adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1917. Later books are 'Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes' (1893) and 
'Return of Sherlock Holmes' (1905), 'His Last Bow' (1917).</summary>
  <summary author="Brontë, Charlotte (1816-1855)" title="Shirley" print_title="Shirley">SHIRLEY, Charlotte Brontë's third novel, was published in 1849. The scene is 
laid in the Yorkshire country with which she had been acquainted from childhood. 
The heroine, Shirley, was drawn from her own sister Emily. The other characters 
include three raw curates, Mr. Malone, Mr. Sweeting, and Mr. Donne, through 
whom Charlotte Bronte probably satirized the curates of her own acquaintance; 
Robert Moore, a mill-owner; his distant cousin, Caroline Helstone, whom he eventually marries; his brother, Louis Moore, who marries Shirley Keeldar, the heroine, and 
a number of others, including workingmen and the neighboring gentry. The story, 
while concerned mainly with no one character, follows, to some extent, the fortunes 
of Robert Moore, who, in his effort to introduce new machinery into his cloth mill, 
has to encounter much opposition from his employes. In her childhood while at 
school at Roe Head, Charlotte Brontë had heard much of the Luddite Riots which 
were taking place in the neighborhood, and which furnished her later for the descriptions of the riots in Shirley. 

The book faithfully reproduces the lives of country gentlefolk, and is richer in 
portrayal of character than in striking incident. Wholesome and genial in tone, it 
remains one of Charlotte Brontë's most attractive novels.</summary>

1877-82). The peculiar charm of Froude as an essayist and historian lies in his 
picturesque and almost romantic manner, making past events and persons live once 
more and move across his pages. The graphic scenes in these 'Short Studies' are 
highly effective, though preserving no logical sequence or relation to one another. 
The first volume begins with a treatise on 'The Science of History'; and the fourth 
ends with the social allegory called 'On a Siding at a Railway Station,' where the 
luggage of a heterogeneous group of passengers is supposed to be examined, and to 
contain not clothing and gewgaws, but specimens of the life-work of each passenger 
or possibly nothing at all, by which he then is judged. The very discursiveness 
of these studies enables one to find here something for various moods, whether 
classic, moral, or aesthetic; whether the thought of war be uppermost in the reader's 
mind, or of travel, or science, or some special phase of the conduct of life. </summary>

American girl who sells herself for a title and finds her experience dearly bought. 
Rosalie Vanderpool, a pretty butterfly, indulged from infancy by her wealthy parents 
and surrounded by every luxury that money can provide, marries Sir Nigel Anstruthers, a dissipated, degenerate Englishman, who visits New York for the purpose of 
securing an heiress to restore his shattered fortunes. Before the waning of the honeymoon Rosalie has discovered her terrible mistake and when her husband takes her 
home to his dilapidated estates and she is confronted by his mother, who equals him 
in coarseness and brutality, she realizes the horror of hei position. Sir Nigel refuses 
to allow his wife any communication with her family and they, thinking she has lost 
her affection for them, consider her as lost to them. Twelve years elapse, and then 
Rosalie's younger sister Betty, who has reached the age of twenty years, and is 
a beautiful girl of great force of character, decides to visit her sister and find out 
what has caused the separation. She arrives unexpectedly at Stornham Court and 
is confronted by a haggard and shabby woman and a hunch-backed boy, who prove 
to be Rosalie and her eleven year-old-son, Ughtred. Betty learns with horror of her 
sister's terrible experiences, and hears of the brutal blow which caused her child's 
deformity and also of the making over of 'her money to her husband who has used it 
all for his own purposes. Sir Nigel being absent for a stay of several months Betty 
at once sets to work to improve matters. She repairs the house and grounds, buys 
new clothes for her sister and restores to her as much as possible her lost youth and 
happiness. Betty becomes deeply interested in Lord Mount Dunstan, a neighbor, 
who is living on his impoverished ancestral estates. Dunstan is a man of strong 
character and loves Betty but will not declare himself while he is poor and she is rich.

Sir Nigel returns from his holiday and fixes his degenerate eye on his attractive 
sister-in-law, who, when in a most critical position, is rescued from his clutches by 
Mount Dunstan. The latter horsewhips the brutal coward, as he deserves, and tells 
Betty of his love, to her great happiness. Sir Nigel dies of a paralytic shock and 
Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpool at last visit the home of their long-lost daughter. </summary>
  <summary author="Eliot, George (1819-1880)" title="Silas Marner" print_title="Silas Marner">SILAS MARNER, by George Eliot (1861). This story of a poor, dull-witted Methodist cloth-weaver is ranked by many critics as the best of its author's books. The 
plot is simple and the field of the action narrow, the strength of the book lying in its 
delineations of character among the common people; for George Eliot has been 
truly called as much the "faultless painter" of bourgeois manners as Thackeray of 
drawing-room society. Silas Marner is a handloom weaver, a good man, whose life 
has been wrecked by a false accusation of theft, which cannot be disproved. For 
years he lives a lonely life, with the sole companionship of his loom; and he is saved 
from his own despair by the chance finding of a little child. On this baby girl he 
lavishes the whole passion of his thwarted nature, and her filial affection makes him a 
kindly man again. After sixteen years the real thief is discovered, and Silas's good 
name is restored. On this slight framework are hung the richest pictures of middle 
and low class life that George Eliot has painted. The foolish, garrulous rustics who 
meet regularly at the Rainbow Inn to guzzle beer and gossip are as much alive as 
Shakespeare's clowns; from the red-faced village farrier to little Mr. Macey, the tailor 
and parish-cleik, who feels himself a Socrates for wisdom. But perhaps the best 
character in the book is Dolly Winthrop, the wheelwright's wife, who looks in every 
day to comfort Silas, a mild soul "whose nature it was to seek out all the sadder 
and more serious elements of life and pasture her mind on them"; and who utters 
a very widely accepted notion of religion when she says, after recommending Silas 
to go frequently to church, as she herself does, "When a bit o' trouble comes, I feel 
as I can put up wi' it, for I've looked for help i' the right quarter, and give myself 
up to Them as we must all give ourselves up to at the last; and if we've done our 
part, it isn't to be believed as Them as are above us 'ud be worse nor we are, and come 
short o' Theira." "The plural pronoun," adds the author, "was no heresy of 
Dolly's but only her way of avoiding a presumptuous familiarity."</summary>
  <summary author="Wagner, Charles (1852-1916)" title="The Simple Life" print_title="The Simple Life">SIMPLE LIFE, THE, by Charles Wagner (1902). This book was translated 
from the French by Mary Louise Hendee, and opens with an introduction and biographical sketch of the author by Grace King. The title, 'The Simple Life,' gives 
at once the keynote to the contents of the volume. The author, who is deeply 
impressed with the increasing complexity of living, and the shams and worldliness of 
the present day, sets forth in a forcible manner the advantages to be derived from 
plain living and high thinking. He dwells upon the useless expenditure of time, 
strength, and money, upon those unnecessary things which instead of adding to one's 
happiness, increase one's cares and responsibilities. In describing the Complex 
life, which most people are striving to attain, Mr. Wagner shows how much valuable 
energy is wasted on the unimportant details of daily living, and how much better 
and happier people would be if they would only content themselves with simpler 
methods. After considering simplicity in a general way the author shows how it 
may be applied to "thought," "speech," "needs," and "pleasures." The mercenary 
spirit of the day and its attendant evils, pride and the love of notoriety, are dwelt upon 
and strongly denounced by the apostle of simple living. He recommends doing 
away with all that is artificial, and quenching the desire for wealth and power. 
He dwells upon the importance of the life in the home, and shows how necessary it is 
that the right thought and influence should prevail there. The home life, Mr. 
Wagner claims, is the germ of the whole social organism, and if the atmosphere can 
be kept free from worldliness the result will be felt in all social institutions. With 
regard to describing simplicity in any worthy manner the author declares his inability 
to do so, for he claims that all the strength, beauty, and joy of life come from that 
source.</summary>

having been brought up among luxurious surroundings, chooses to give up all for the 
cause of Christ. Being an orphan, he has lived from childhood with his rich uncle, 
Mr. Hermon Worcester, who intends to make him his heir. Bayard goes to the 
Theological Seminary at Cesarea where he cannot sincerely subscribe to some of the 
doctrines and is accordingly judged "unsound," and thereby wins the disapproval 
of the faculty and also of his uncle, who is one of the trustees of the seminary. He 
accepts a call to a small parish in Windover, a seaport town, where he ministers 
with great patience and self-sacrifice to a congregation made up from the roughest 
and lowest elements of society. While in Cesarea, Bayard had gained the friendship 
of Helen Carruth, the daughter of the professor of Theology, a handsome and brilliant 
girl, whom later he passionately loves; he undergoes many struggles before he can 
convince himself that it is right for him to marry, or to ask Helen to share his poverty, 
but finally his great love, which she reciprocates, conquers all obstacles. Bayard's 
uncle dies and leaves him a small legacy, which is however sufficient to make him 
independent, and he and Helen are married. They return from their wedding trip 
for the dedication of Bayard's new chapel for which he has labored untiringly and 
which is called the Church of "Christlove." As they are leaving the chapel after 
the service, Bayard is struck by a missile from the hands of a miserable wretch 
named Ben Trawl. The blow proves fatal and after a week of suffering, borne with 
fortitude and courage and tended by his heartbroken wife, Bayard dies, leaving behind 
him the legacy of an unselfish and noble life.</summary>

adventure, the scene of which is laid in England in the fourteenth century. In 
prefacing the story, the author asserts that he has taken great pains to make the local 
coloring correct and has studied many authorities in order to make the book an 
authentic historic reproduction. The hero of the tale is Nigel Loring, the descendant 
of a noble family and the last of his race. In the opening chapters he is living alone 
with his aged grandmother, Lady Ermyntrude Loring, upon a small remnant of their 
great estate which has been devastated by pestilence and wrested from them by law. 
Even this small holding is in danger of passing out of their hands, as for years a feud 
has existed between the monks of Waverley and the house of Loring, and the former 
are endeavoring to make the impoverishment of the Lorings complete. King Edward 
and his suite pay a visit to Tilford Manor House, the Loring home, and in order to 
provide for his entertainment Lady Ermyntrude sells a jewelled goblet, a bracelet, 
and a golden salver that are her choicest possessions. The King is pleased with 
young Nigel, and when the latter sues to be taken into his service, he makes him 
squire to Sir John Chandos, one of his principal knights. The financial embarrassment of the Lorings is relieved by the King and he settles the difficulties that over-shadow their estate. Nigel fits himself with armor and goes to join the King after 
having taken leave of his sweetheart Mary Buttesthorn, daughter of Sir John Buttesthorn, a neighbor and friend. Nigel's military experiences are both varied and 
eventful. He is involved in adventures of all kinds but his courage and intrepidity 
bring him safely through his many perils. The climax of Nigel's military career is 
reached when he is fighting against the French under the Black Prince with his 
beloved master Chandos and plays a prominent part at the time of the surrender of 
King John. For his valor on this occasion he is knighted by the Black Prince and 
returns home as Sir Nigel loring to wed his faithful lady-love. The experiences 
recounted in this volume are prior to those related in 'The White Company,' a 
previous publication.</summary>

powerful story opens with a picture of the ancestral home of the Calmadys, in which 
the hero's father seems destined to enjoy, with his young wife, complete and lasting 
happiness. Then follows an accident in the hunting field and Sir Richard is brought 
home mangled; he dies despite the efforts of the'surgeons to save him by amputating 
his injured legs. A few months later the hero of the book is born, a beautiful healthy 
child in all respects save one the lower part of each leg is missing, the feet being 
attached at the point where the knees should be. As child and young man, Sir 
Richard Calmady behaves in the most exemplary manner, despite his misfortune 
and the constant reminders of it, from which his wealth and position cannot shield 
him. Lady Calmady's life is devoted to her son, and some of the scenes between the 
two are the best in the book. The young man wishing to marry, selects a sweet but 
stupid little scion of the nobility, who at the eleventh hour begs to be released in order 
to marry another. Sir Richard now undergoes a moral revolution and gives himself 
up to dissipation. He succumbs to the wiles of a fair and wayward cousin, only to 
be afterward insulted and maltreated at the hands of one of her cast-off lovers. 
Nursed back from the resulting fever by his neglected mother, who hastens to his bedside in Naples, he at last returns home, a confirmed misanthrope and misogynist.

Becoming convinced, however, of the wrongfulness of this attitude of mind, he turns 
his attention to charity and founds a home for cripples, and as a reward wins the 
heart and hand of a handsome and admirable woman, with whom his acquaintance 
has hitherto been a superficial one. The book abounds in epigram, allusion, and 
vivid character-painting, but its unshrinking realism is sometimes repellent.</summary>

hero of countless marvelous exploits. Bellew, who has drifted into journalism in 
San Francisco, is invited by his uncle to take a short trip to the gold-region, the elder 
man deploring the "softness " of his dilettante nephew, who seems to have degenerated 
from the hardihood and physical prowess of his race. At the first taste of the wild 
life, however, the young man's inheritance asserts itself and he decides to remain in 
the Klondike instead of returning with his uncle. He immediately plunges into the 
strenuous activities of the North and in a short space of time trains himself to battle 
successfully with the elements and to endure the terrible hardships of the country. 
At the outset he is spurred on by an encounter with a spirited girl named Joy Gastell, 
whose father is an "Old-timer" and who from childhood has been accustomed to 
cast her lot in with the hardy explorers. From time to time Bellew encounters this 
daring beauty, who aids him at several critical junctures and to whom he is able to 
render important services in return. In company with his special chum "Shorty," 
Bellew works his way up to Dawson and subsists for some time by hunting and trading 
in moose-meat. The friends join an exciting stampede to Squam Creek to take out 
claims, but are outwitted by Joy Gastell, who, in the interest of her father leads 
them on to a wrong trail. Later she makes amends for this trick by offering Bellew 
a chance to secure another claim to acquire which he has a neck-and-neck race with a 
formidable rival "Big Olaf "; the result is a tie which causes the two to divide the 
claim. Bellew has a thrilling escape from death on a glacier where in order to save 
his companion he cuts loose from the rope which is attached to the other; he outwits a 
coterie of gamblers at Dawson and thereby amasses a large sum of money and after 
many experiences he is captured by a tribe of Indians and forced to remain in their 
isolated settlement. He'finally makes his escape in company with the daughter of 
the chief, who is a white man; the girl has fallen in love with him, and heroically aids 
him in his return to freedom, herself perishing from starvation just as the goal is

1866. It is described by him as "a picture of an old-fashioned farmer's fireside in 
winter." The metre resembles that of Scott's 'Lay of the Last Minstrel'; iambic 
tetrameter couplets predominate, but occasionally, alternating or interlacing rhymes 
are introduced to vary the movement. In depicting a New-England family gathering 
on a snowy winter evening Whittier is describing his own home circle as it was in his 
boyhood at East Haverhill, Massachusetts, After an account of the farm-house 
shut off from the world by a roaring blizzard an account made particularly vivid 
by a wealth of homely and expressive detail Whittier shows the group about the 
blazing oak fire. The father tells of his wanderings in Canadian forests and lumber
camps and his labors on the marshes and fishing-grounds of the New Engknd coast. 
The mother describes Indian raids and massacres during the French wars in New 
Hampshire or reads from old Quaker books of martyrology and religious experience. 
The uncle delights the children with his rich lore of hunting and fishing, and the aunt 
describes the huskings and apple-bees of her girlhood. The village schoolmaster 
speaks of "classic Dartmouth's college halls," plays the fiddle, and tells of his experiences at parties in country settlements. There is present a guest, Harriet Livermore, a religious enthusiast, a traveler, and a woman of the world. Her complex and 
unstable temperament and her charm of personality are brilliantly portrayed by the 
poet. Fraternal tributes are also paid to Whittier's brother and two sisters. The 
storm keeps the party snow-bound for a week, during which the various occupations 
and amusements of the farm are described with the poet's usual fidelity. 'Snow Bound' is a characteristic product of rural New England its scenery, types of 
character, mode of life, and ideals are thoroughly representative of the soil. The 
absolute truth and sincerity of the poem, its pictorial power, and its family loyalty 
and affection are its outstanding merits.</summary>
  <summary author="Arnold, Matthew (1822-1888)" title="Sohrab and Rustum and Other Poems" print_title="Sohrab and Rustum\nand\nOther Poems">SOHRAB AND RUSTUM, a narrative poem by Matthew Arnold, first appeared in a 
volume of his poems published in 1853. In the sub-title he calls it 'An Episode,' 
evidently intending it as an imagined extract from a long epic poem in the Homeric 
manner. Its rapidity, simplicity, vividness, and nobility are all in accordance with 
his views of Homer's style, and the epic similes, proper names, and descriptive 
details are so selected as to suggest by their local color the Asiatic background. The 
story that of a combat between a father and a son who do not know one another 
is a well-known theme of heroic poetry, occurring in the Old High German 'Hildebrandslied' and in the Persian poet Firdausi's epic, 'Shah Namah,' the ultimate
source of Arnold's poem. Rustum, the mightiest chieftain of the Persians, in the 
course of his wanderings, marries the daughter of the king of Ader-baijan, but leaves 
her in order to continue his military exploits. She bears him a son named Sohrab, 
but fearing that the father will take him away to be a warrior sends Rustum word that 
the child is a girl. Sohrab, grown to young manhood and longing to find his father, 
takes service with the Tartar king, Afrasiab, hoping to draw the attention of Rustum 
by his feats of arms. As a means of quicker fame he takes occasion of an impending 
battle between the Tartars and the Persians to challenge the bravest Persian champion to single fight. Rustum, who is with the Persian army, though retired like 
Achilles on account of the Persian king's neglect, yields to the entreaties of his fellow chieftains and accepts the challenge, but in plain armor and without announcing his 
name. When Sohrab first sees his antagonist he has an intuition that it is Rustum 
and eagerly inquires if this is not so. But Rustum, ignorant of his motive and 
suspecting him of seeking some pretext not to fight, refuses to reveal his identity and 
dares Sohrab to come on. In their first encounter, after an exchange of spears, 
Sohrab cleverly evades his opponent's club, by the weight of which Rustum loses his 
balance and falls; but Sohrab courteously refrains from this advantage and offers 
truce. Rustum, however, is enraged at his downfall and renews the struggle with 
fury. The fight is long and close and made more dreadful by a sand-storm which 
envelops the combatants. At length Rustum, hard-pressed, shouts his own name 
with the effect that Sohrab, in bewilderment, ceases to fight and is pierced by his 
father's spear. Dying on the sand he declares that Rustum, his father, will avenge 
his death; and in the affecting scene which follows, the truth at last comes out 
by means of a seal pricked on Sohrab 's arm by his mother. At the close of the 
poem the father is left mourning over his son by the banks of the Oxus; and 
the poet's description of the river's northward course under the stars and 
moonlight to the Aral Sea affords a welcome relief from the emotional tension of 
the story.</summary>

Robert Clay, a self-made man, an engineer, general manager, and resident director of 
the Valencia Mining Company in Olancho. Although the novel is full of adventure, 
it is primarily a study of two types of women, two sisters, the daughters of Mr. 
Langham, president of the company. The elder is a New York society girl of a most 
finished type, self-possessed, calmly critical, with emotions well in check, noble, 
but not noble to the point of bad form. Her sister Hope, not yet out, is enthusiastic, 
generous, sweet. Robert Clay meets the elder, Alice Langham, at a dinner just 
before he sails for South America. He has long known of her through portraits in the 
society newspapers. He has an ideal of her as a woman unspoiled by wealth and 
position. He half confides to her his admiration of her. Later when he learns that 
she and her sister, with their father, are coming to Olancho to visit their brother and 
to see the mines, he is wild with delight. But he is doomed to disappointment in the 
character of Alice. Appreciative and sensitive as she seems, she has herself too well 
under control, is always afraid of going too far, is never quite sure of Robert Clay's 
desirability as a husband. Her coldness chills and alienates Clay. Hope, on the 
other hand, gives expression to her genuine enthusiasm. She is delighted with the
strangeness of the life, is as interested in the mines as if she herself were a director. 
In the dangers and excitements of the revolution, which breaks out during her visit, 
she displays courage, nerve, and womanliness. The nobility in Clay's nature draws 
her to him. He loves her and claims her for his wife. Alice is left to marry a conventional society man of her own type. 'Soldiers of Fortune' is well written and 
readable. Full of excitement as it is, the dramatic incidents in it are yet subordinated 
to the delineation of character.</summary>

usages distinguishing all Far Eastern peoples, the author classes the far less pronounced individualism of those races, as compared with Westerns: Peoples, he says, 
grow steadily more individual as we go westward. In the Far East the social unit is 
not the individual but the family: among the Easterns a normally constituted son 
knows not what it is to possess a spontaneity of his own. A Chinese son cannot 
properly be said to own anything. This state of things is curiously reflected in the 
language of Japan, which has no personal pronouns: one cannot say in Japanese, I, 
Thou, He. The Japanese are born artists: to call a Japanese cook an artist is to 
state a simple fact, for Japanese food is beautiful, though it may not. be agreeable to 
the taste. Half of the teachings of the Buddhist religion are inculcations of charity or 
fellow-feeling: not only is man enjoined to show kindliness to fellowmen, but to all 
animals as well. The people practice what their Scriptures teach; and the effect 
indirectly on the condition of the brutes is almost as marked as its more direct effect

of the Spain of to-day have the additional value of a probable future reference. 
There is no attempt to review political events in the work, only to present a striking 
and faithful photograph of the essential characteristics of the country, and catalogue 
particular and local features. If one were forced to select among a number of 
delightful pictures, perhaps the chapter on 'Andalusia and the Alhambra' would be 
chosen; but to that on 'The Lost City' the eye turns again and again with ever 
renewed interest. The last pages are devoted to 'Hints to Travelers,' and are useful 
in supplying certain information not to be found in the usual guide-book, and condensing this in a very convenient form.</summary>
  <summary author="Morton, Thomas (1764-1838)" title="Speed the Plough" print_title="Speed the Plough">SPEED THE PLOUGH, by Thomas Morton. To this comedy, first produced in 
1796, we owe one of our best-known characters, the redoubtable Mrs. Grundy. 
Here as elsewhere she is invisible; and it is what she may say, not what she does say, 
that Dame Ashfield fears. Farmer Ashfield has brought up from infancy a young 
man named Henry, whose parentage is unknown. Sir Philip Blandford, Ashfield's 
landlord, is about to return after many years' absence, to marry his daughter Emma 
to Bob Handy, who "can do everything but earn his bread." Sir Abel, Bob's father, 
is to pay all Blandford's debt. In a plowing-match, Henry wins the prize, and 
Emma bestows the medal. It is a case of love at first sight. Sir Philip hates Henry, 
and orders Ashfield to turn him from his doors, but he refuses. Sir Philip is about to
force Ashfield to discharge a debt, when a man named Morrington gives Henry the 
note of Sir Philip for more than the amount. Henry destroys it, when Sir Philip 
declares that Morrington, whom he has never seen, has by encouraging Sir Philip's 
vices when young, possessed himself of enough notes to more than exhaust Sir Philip's 
fortune. Sir Philip confides his secret to Bob. He was to marry a young girl, when 
he found her about to elope with his brother Charles. He killed Charles, and hid the 
knife and a bloody cloth in a part of the castle which he has never visited since. Sir 
Abel, in experimenting with a substitute for gunpowder, sets the castle on fire. 
Henry saves Emma from the flames; and breaking into the secret room, brings forth 
the knife and cloth. Monington appears, and proves to be Sir Philip's brother and 
Henry's father. To atone for the wrong done his brother, he had gathered all the 
notes which his brother had given to usurers, and now gives them to him. Bob marries 
Susan, Ashfield 's daughter, whom he was about to desert for Emma; and the latter 
is married to Henry.</summary>
  <summary author="Beach, Rex (1877-1949)" title="The Spoilers" print_title="The Spoilers">SPOILERS, THE, by Rex Beach (1905). The scene of this story is kid in the Klondike while the gold fever is at its height. The central figure in the narrative is Roy 
Glenister, a man of powerful nature, whose theory of life is that force can accomplish 
anything. He and his partner Bill Dextry are returning to Klondike after an enforced absence and as their ship is about to sail their attention is drawn to a beautiful 
young girl who is endeavoring to evade the quarantine officers and board their 
steamer. Glenister exerts himself in her behalf and succeeds in rescuing her from her 
pursuers. Her name is Helen Chester and her rescuer falls in love with her on the 
voyage and endeavors to force her to reciprocate his affection. Instead, however, 
he wins her scorn by kissing her against her will and she vows she will never forgive 
him. Upon reaching Klondike Glenister finds that there is litigation over his claim, 
which contains a valuable gold mine, and he must fight to keep it in his possession. 
His principal enemy is a political boss named McNamera who does everything in his 
power to ruin him. Glenister 's love for Helen proves a deep influence in his life and 
softens and refines his nature, though she remains obdurate to his suit. McNamera, 
who is also a rival in love, succeeds in getting Helen to look favorably upon his 
proposal. Helen has brought with her to Klondike papers, the contents of which she 
is ignorant of, but which prove to be the instrument by which Glenister's claim is to 
be proved invalid. They are held by an unscrupulous lawyer who bargains to reveal 
the contents to Helen in return for her love. She accedes to his proposition but is 
rescued from his clutches by a notorious gambler called Brancho Kid, who proves to 
be her wayward brother whom she has not seen for years. Glenister conquers McNamera in a fierce weaponless duel and the latter is proved to be a scoundrel. Helen 
gives Glenister the papers but he refuses to make use of them as by so doing he would 
ruin her uncle Judge Stillman, who is criminally involved with McNamera. This 
generous action which culminates a series of sacrifices made by Glenister for Helen 
causes her to appreciate his true character and she confesses her love to him.</summary>

the Pilgrims"; and with this charming and authentic narrative the author begins her 
series of tales relating to the Plymouth Colony. The book is full of romantic and 
dramatic episodes, all of which are founded on fact, and are therefore doubly interesting. In the opening chapters the Pilgrims are first pictured on board the Mayflower, 
lying at anchor, where they are passing the dreary weeks until the pioneers of the 
colony can decide on a suitable place for a settlement. At last the location is chosen; 
and the few log cabins which serve as abiding places for the Pilgrims prove foundation 
stones for the flourishing town of Plymouth. Throughout the story Miles Standish, 
who can rightfully be called the hero of this tale figures prominently. His manliness 
and courage in overcoming obstacles and adversity, his tenderness and kindness to 
the sick and suffering, and his deep love and devotion for sweet Rose Standish, form a 
striking picture. Her death, which occurs soon after their landing, causes him the 
deepest sorrow, but he eventually feels it his duty to marry again; and John Alden's 
interview with Priscilla Molines in his behalf is picturesquely described. His subsequent marriage to his cousin Barbara Standish, which occurs after a stormy courtship, ends this interesting narrative. Throughout the story the privations and 
sufferings of the Pilgrims, which they bear with such courage and fortitude, are 
pictured in the most graphic manner. Governor Carver and his gentle and delicate 
wife; John Harland, their faithful friend and helper; and Mary Chilton, who has 
historic interest as being the first woman to step on shore, are also charmingly portrayed.</summary>
  <summary author="Crockett, S. R. (Samuel Rutherford) (1860-1914)" title="The Stickit Minister" print_title="The Stickit Minister">STICKIT MINISTER, THE, by S. R. Crockett (1893). The short stories, by S. R. 
Crockett, contained in the collection called 'The Stickit Minister, and Some Common 
Men,' were first printed in a newspaper. 

These stories of "that gray Galloway Land," as the author calls it, are told in a 
very simple, pathetic way. The "stickit minister" is a young divinity student, who 
learns that he must die in a few years from consumption. He and his younger brother 
have inherited bat a small property; so, in order that his brother may study to become 
a doctor, he leaves college and goes home to cultivate the farm. It is generally supposed that he has failed to pass his examination, whence the name "stickit stuck 
fast minister"; and even his brother treats him with coldness and ingratitude. 

The second story, 'Accepted ot the Beasts,' tells of a pure-hearted, noble young 
clergyman, who is turned out of his church because of certain unfounded accusations 
brought against him by the machination of an evil-minded woman. Next morning 
a farmer discovers him singing "He was despised and rejected of men" to a herd of 
cattle, which press about him to listen. A few hours later he is found lying dead. 

'A Heathen Lintie' is the story of a middle-aged Scotch woman, who has secretly 
written and has had published a volume of poems. She watches anxiously for the 
paper which is to contain a review of them. At last it comes ; but she dies before she is 
able to read enough of it to discover that what she believes is praise is in reality cruel, 
scathing criticism. 

Some of the stories as 'A Midsummer Idyl,' 'Three Bridegrooms and One 
Bride,' and 'A Knight-Errant of the Streets' are less pathetic and more humorous.</summary>

The story is told in the first person by a boy who has never known any other life, and 
whose farthest goal of experience is the neighboring town. It is a masterpiece of 
modern "realism," the life and events of the place being described with a marvelous 
fidelity. Yet the test of veracity fails in the unrelieved gloom of the story, which is 
bereft of all sunshine and joyousness, and even of all sense of relation to happier 
things. The town of Twin Mounds seems as isolated and strange as if it were in 
another world. Even nature is utterly cheerless and human life apparently without 
hope. The narrative itself is loose and rambling, centering about the domestic 
troubles of Joe Erring and his wife, and culminating in dreary tragedy. The book has 
a grim fascination; and at least one extraordinary character, Lyth Biggs, whose 
cynical philosophizing leaves the reader fairly benumbed by the chill of its candor.</summary>
  <summary author="Schreiner, Olive (1855-1920)" title="The Story of an African Farm" print_title="The Story\nof an\nAfrican Farm">STORY OF AN AFRICAN FARM, THE, a novel published in 1 883 under the pseudonym of "Ralph Iron," really by Olive Schreiner. On a realistic background of 
South African landscape and farm-life the author depicts the aspirations and disillusionments of youth in an age of disintegrating faith and ideals. Waldo and Lyndall, the central personages of the story, are brought up on a Boer farm, in Cape 
Colony, Waldo being the son of the German overseer and Lyndall, an orphan girl, 
cousin of Em, who is stepdaughter to Tant' Sannie the Boer mistress of the farm. 
The two girls were left in the guardianship of Tant 1 Sannie at the death of Em's 
father, an Englishman, the Boer woman's second husband. Although Tant' Sannie 
is ignorant and selfish the children lead a life of happy companionship at the cabin of 
the overseer, a kindly, simple-hearted South German of a childlike trust and piety. 
On this idyllic scene arrives a clever scoundrel named Bonaparte Blenkins who by 
the grossest flattery gets the confidence of Tant 1 Sannie, induces her to turn away 
the German who had befriended him, and on his death, subjects the boy Waldo to the 
most malignant persecution and finally to a cruel beating. Shortly afterwards, 
through indiscreetly making love to another Boer woman, Tant Sannie's niece, 
Blenkins is driven from the farm. The sufferings that Waldo has endured and the 
revelation of evil which the experience has brought have utterly destroyed his former 
childlike faith in God. Contact with modern thought in the books that he procures 
deepens his confusion. His life becomes an aspiration for a knowledge of truth which 
experience will not give him. This aspiration becomes defined by an allegorical tale 
related to him by a stranger, a man of the world, who happens to be resting at the 
farm and is interested by the boy's face and words. Waldo determines to seek work
in the cities, to read, and to see life. While he seeks knowledge, Lyndall yearns for 
power. Possessed of unusual beauty and charm and great force of personality she 
succeeds in making her guardian send her to school at Cape Town. Disregarding the 
conventional studies there, she reads and thinks as she pleases, and in four years 
becomes an accomplished woman, the writer of a number of successful novels and 
plays, and an ardent upholder of woman's independence. Being extremely beautiful 
and attractive, she has many admirers. With one of these she forms a connection 
which she will not permit to be made permanent by marriage, because she feels that 
the man's love is one merely of possession and that he appeals only to half of her 
nature. Returning home she finds Tant' Sannie about to be married again, thus 
leaving the farm to Em, who has just become engaged to a girlish young Englishman, 
Gregory Rose, lessee of half the farm. Lyndall and Waldo in several long colloquies 
exchange experiences in a mood of absolute comradeship, not as woman and man but 
as spirit and spirit. He then departs for the cities on his search for a knowledge of 
life. Meanwhile, though Lyndall scorns Gregory's femininity, he has become fascinated by her; and when released by Em, who sees how matters stand, declares his 
love. Lyndall, who expects soon to become a mother, scornfully tells him he may 
give her his name; but her lover having followed her to the farm and again offered 
marriage, she clandestinely departs under his protection, though still refusing any 
legal tie. They go to the Transvaal, where they soon quarrel and separate. Lyndall 
gives birth to a child, which dies a few hours afterwards. She is cared for until her 
death, which soon follows, by her rejected suitor, Gregory, who has traced her to the 
inn at which she is staying, and who attends her with devotion and tenderness, in the 
disguise of a nurse. Meanwhile, Waldo, after months of wandering, varied employments, reading, and meditation, returns to the farm, hoping to hear something of 
Lyndall. The news of her death deprives him of any further instinct for existence. 
He dies peacefully, sitting in the sun on a lovely summer afternoon. The marriage 
of Gregory and Em closes the story. </summary>
  <summary author="Ward, Humphry, Mrs. (1851-1920)" title="The Story of Bessie Costrell" print_title="The Story of\nBessie Costrell">STORY OF BESSIE COSTRELL, THE, by Mrs. Humphry Ward (1895). In this 
story Mrs. Ward has depicted life among the working classes under most painful and 
trying conditions. Bessie Costrell is the niece of John Bolderfield, an old man who, 
by dint of scrimping and saving for many years, has accumulated by hard labor 
enough money to support himself for the remainder of his life. This wealth, the 
acquirement of which has been the one ambition of his life, has been kept hoarded in 
an old trunk; and this he confides to the care of his niece, before leaving his native 
town for a period of some months. Bessie is much delighted to be given charge of 
the money, and at first only regards it with honest feelings of pride; but eventually 
the temptation becomes too strong for her, and her natural extravagance asserting 
itself, she opens the chest and spends part of the money in a reckless way, drinking 
and treating her friends. At length her free use of money begins to arouse suspicion; 
and she takes alarm and goes to the chest to count the balance, when she is caught 
in the act by her husband's profligate son, who assaults her and robs her of the remainder. Matters have reached this crisis when John returns home and, to his horror 
and consternation, finds his money gone. He is at first prostrated by the terrible 
discovery; but on recovering consciousness, he accuses Bessie of the theft, which she 
strenuously denies. John then sends for the constable, who succeeds in proving her 
guilt. Bessie's husband, Isaac Costrell, a stern, hard man, who is a leader in the 
church, is overcome with horror on learning of his wife's dishonesty, agrees that she 
will have to go to prison, and tells her that he will have nothing more to do with her.
The wretched woman, overwhelmed with terror and grief, drowns herself in a well, 
and the narrative ends leaving the husband filled with remorse, and John broken-hearted and penniless. The story is told in a realistic manner; and although many of 
the situations are unpleasant, it bears the mark of a master hand.</summary>
  <summary author="Galsworthy, John (1867-1933)" title="Strife" print_title="Strife">STRIFE, by John Galsworthy (1909). The conflict in this drama is between capital 
and labor. A strike has been in progress at the Trengartha Tin Plate Works for 
months, until the men and their wives and children are starving, and the corporation 
is on the verge of bankruptcy. Both sides are disheartened, and ready for compromise, but the strike is prolonged by fanatical leaders who represent the extreme types 
of capital and labor. David Roberts, leader of the strikers, has a grievance against 
the company because it has underpaid him for a valuable invention, but he is fighting 
not for himself, or even for the other strikers, but for the future against the master, 
Capital, beating the life out of Labor. His demands are excessive, and he has therefore 
lost the support of the trade union, which represents the spirit of compromise. The 
directors are led by John Anthony, the founder of the company, and for thirty-two 
years its president. He is determined to fight and win, as he has so often fought and 
always won. To the remonstrances of his son and daughter, who sympathize with 
the men, and to the timid expostulations of the directors who, like the strikers, are 
fighting only for the welfare of themselves and their families, he replies in terms of the 
future. Capital and Labor are at war, and the defeat of Capital means mob government. Every concession will be but the prelude to more extravagant demands. 
The second act reveals in one scene the sufferings of the women and in another scene
tne turbulent disaffection of the men. Roberts, in a fiery speech, has won the strikers 
over to the side of strife, when news is brought to him that his wife has died of her 
enforced privations. The meeting, bereft of his presence at the crucial moment, votes 
for conciliation. The last act shows John Anthony voted down by his directors and 
forced to resign the presidency of the company. The secretary of the corporation 
and the union leader discover that the terms of settlement are identical with the ones 
offered at the beginning of the fight so that nothing has been gained by either side, 
through all the months of strife and misery and economic waste, except that the best 
man of each side has been broken irretrievably. The author conceives the leader of 
capital in as generous a spirit, and in as true a light as the leader of labor, great figures, 
worthy of each other's steel, akin to each other, towering head and shoulders above 
the men who desert and betray them. </summary>
  <summary author="Hazlitt, William (1778-1830)" title="Table Talk: Essays on Men and Manners" print_title="Table Talk:\nEssays on Men and Manners">TABLE TALK, or, ORIGINAL ESSAYS, by William Hazlitt, was originally published 
in two volumes, the first in 1821 and the second in 1822. Among its thirty-three 
essays may be mentioned 'On the Pleasures of Painting,' which sets forth with the 
author's usual romantic gusto the delights of the artist both in observation and in 
creation; Hazlitt's personal interest in art also appears in the essays on Sir Joshua 
Reynolds's 'Discourses on Painting' and on a landscape by Nicholas Poussin. In 
'The Indian Jugglers' he contrasts the marvelous perfection attained by these entertainers, by rope-dancers, and by professional sportsmen like Cavanagh, a fives-player of his acquaintance, with the relative inadequacy of the work of painters, 
essayists, and poets; yet he concludes that the latter, having set themselves the harder 
task, are worthy of greater honor. 'On Going a Journey' reveals Hazlitt's fondness 
for solitary walking and for the comforts of good food and a snug inn. It records 
the luxurious sentiment with which he recalled the surroundings and details of some 
roadside meal with a favorite book in his youthful days. A number of the essays are 
on the usual general topics, e. g., 'On Genius and Common Sense,' 'On Vulgarity and 
Affectation.' These are treated in Hazlitt's characteristic sinewy style, with an 
abundance of apt quotations, particularly from Shakespeare, Spenser, and the early 
dramatists, and not infrequently a line from Wordsworth or Coleridge. Dramatic 
criticism is represented in 'Whether Actors Ought to Sit in the Boxes' (at intervals 
during the performance) a question answered in the negative because the practice 
destroys illusion; and literary criticism appears in the essays on 'Familiar Style' and 
'Milton's Sonnets.' On the whole, this volume is pretty broadly representative of 
Hazlitt's personality and genius.

  <summary author="Cowper, William (1731-1800)" title="The Task, and Other Poems" print_title="The Task,\nand Other Poems">TASK, THE, a descriptive and reflective poem by William Cowper, published in 1785. 
It was begun at the instance of the poet's friend, Lady Austen, who playfully asked 
him to write a poem in blank-verse about a sofa. Accepting the challenge Cowper 
traces in about one hundred Miltonic lines the evolution of the sofa from the stool. 
He then proceeds discursively to enlarge on the pleasures of country walks, the delights of gardening, and the coziness of the winter fireside, mingling these descriptive 
passages with autobiographic records of religious experience, satirical attacks on the 
luxury of cities, the corruption of politicians and the worldliness of the clergy, pietistic 
denunciations of deism, skepticism, and natural science, and outbursts of humanitarian sympathy for slaves, dumb animals, and all who are oppressed. These and 
other topics occupy six books entitled respectively: 'The Sofa,' 'The Time-Piece' 
(i.e., the omens of future judgment), 'The Garden,' 'The Winter Evening,' 'The 
Winter Morning Walk,' 'The Winter Walk at Noon.' 'The Task' reflects the
enthusiasm for natural scenery, the impulse to self-revelation, and the eagerness to 
relieve suffering, of the later eighteenth century. The author is a refined, sensitive 
Christian gentleman with a gift of easy, graceful expression, and a nature of fine 
sensibility and quiet humor. The morbid strain which so sadly affected his peace 
and happiness left no trace on this poem.</summary>
  <summary author="Shakespeare, William (1564-1616)" title="The Tempest" print_title="The Tempest">TEMPEST, THE, one of Shakespeare's very latest plays (1611), written in the 
mellow maturity of his genius, is probably based on a lost Italian novella or play, 
though certain incidents are borrowed from three pamphlets on the Bermudas and 
Virginia and from Florio's Montaigne. The scene is said to be laid in the haunted 
island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean. In the opening lines we see a ship 
laboring in heavy seas near the shore of an island, whose sole inhabitants, besides the 
spirits of earth and air typified in the dainty yet powerful sprite Ariel, are Prospero 
and his lovely daughter Miranda, and their slave, the deformed boor Caliban, an 
aborigine of the island. The grave and good Prospero is a luckier castaway than 
Robinson Crusoe, in that his old friend Gonzalo put into the boat with him not only 
his infant daughter, but clothes, and some books of magic, by the aid of which both 
men and spirits, and the very elements, are subject to the beck of his wand. He was 
the rightful Duke of Milan, but was supplanted by his brother Antonio, who with his
confederate, the king of Naples, and the latter's son Ferdinand and others, is cast 
ashore on the island. The shipwreck occurs full in the sight of the weeping Miranda; 
but all hands are saved, and the ship too. The humorous characters are the butler 
Stephano, and the court jester Trinculo, both semi-drunk, their speech and songs 
caught from the sailors, and savoring of salt and tar. Throughout the play the 
three groups of personages, the royal retinue with the irrepressible and malapropos 
old Gonzalo, the drunken fellows and Caliban, and Prospero with his daughter and 
Ferdinand, move leisurely to and fro, the whole action taking up only three 
hours. The three boors, fuddled with their fine liquor and bearing the bark bottle, 
rove about the enchanted island, fall into the filthy-mantled pool, and are stoutly 
pinched by Prospero's goblins for theft. The murderous plot of Antonio and the 
courtier Sebastian is exposed at the phantom banquet of the harpies. Spellbound 
in the linden grove, all the guilty parties come forward into a charmed circle and take 
a lecture from Prospero. General reconciliation. Then finally, Miranda and Ferdinand are discovered playing chess before Prospero's cell, and learn that to-morrow 
they set sail for Naples to be married.</summary>

exploration and adventure was employed, in 1865-67, by the Western Union Telegraph 
Company, in its audacious scheme of building an overland line to Europe by way of 
Alaska, Bering's Strait, and Siberia, a futile project, soon forgotten in the success 
of the Atlantic Cable. He tells the story of the undertaking from the side of the 
employees, a story known to few even of the original projectors. It is a record of 
obstacles well-nigh insuperable met and overcome with astonishing patience and
courage; of nearly six thousand miles of unbroken wilderness explored in two years, 
from Vancouver's Island to Bering's Straits, and from Bering's Straits to the Chinese 
frontier; of camping in the wildest mountain fastnesses of Kamtchatka, in the gloomy 
forests of Alaska and British Columbia, and on the desolate plains of Northeastern 
Siberia; of the rugged mountain passes of Northern Asia traversed by hardy men 
mounted on reindeer; of the great rivers of the North navigated in skin canoes; of 
tents pitched on northern plains in temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees below zero. 

Though the enterprise failed in its special aim, it succeeded in contributing to 
our knowledge of a hitherto untraveled and unknown region. Its surveys and 
explorations are invaluable. The life and customs of the natives are minutely 
described; while the traveler's sense of thevastness, the desolation, and the appalling 
emptiness of this northern world of snow and ice conveys a chill almost of death to the 
sympathetic reader. The book is written in the simple, business-like style that, 
when used by men of action to tell what they have done, adds a great charm of 
reality to the tale. </summary>

an embodiment in fiction of the Tragedy of the Woman, the world-old story of 
her fall, and of her battle with man to recover her virginity of soul. Tess, a beautiful 
village girl, is a lineal descendant of the ancient D'Urberville family. Her far-off 
gentle blood shows itself in her passionate sensitive nature. By a mere accident 
she becomes the prey of a young man of gross instincts, returning to her home soiled 
and dismayed. Her child is born and dies. "Her physical blight becomes her 
mental harvest'*; she is lifted above the groping mental state of the people about her. 
This etherealization has fatal results. As she was once the victim of man's vices, 
she is destined to become the victim of his conventional virtues. At a farm far 
removed from the scene of her sufferings, she meets Angel Clare, a gentleman's son. 
Their mutual love ends in marriage. On their wedding-day Tess tells Clare of her 
past. From that hour she ceases to be for him "enskied and sainted " becoming 
a mere soiled thing which had drifted in its perilous beauty across his path. He 
leaves her; and her struggle with her anguish of spirit, with her poverty, and her 
despair, has a fearful ending: "The President of the Immortals" had finished his 
sport with her. 'Tess' is well-nigh primeval in its treatment. A novel created 
apparently by inexorable forces of nature, it is joined by its strength and pitilessness 
to the blind powers of the world. Yet it is not without sunny spaces, revelations 
of warm nooks of earth hidden from the blasts of the tempest. </summary>
  <summary author="Veblen, Thorstein (1857-1929)" title="The Theory of the Leisure Class" print_title="The Theory\nof the\nLeisure Class">THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS, THE, 'An Economic Study of Institutions 
by Thorstein Veblen (1899). It is a merciless analysis, from the strictly economic 
point of view, of the claims of the leisure class to be a valuable factor in modern 
life. He finds that this class originated in the stages of savagery, when the men of the 
tribe devoted themselves to predatory acquisition, leaving the productive work to
women and slaves. In the barbaric stage, which followed, the control of wealth and 
freedom from labor marked the nobility and work was regarded as a badge of social 
inferiority. This feeling continued when the growth of industrial activity led to the 
modern struggle for wealth ; and the ruling classes who emerged from this struggle 
were characterized by two distinctive features: "conspicuous leisure and conspicuous 
consumption." By the first term the author means the tendency of the upper classes 
to avoid menial labor and associations, to cultivate manners and modes of speech 
which suggest a life of elegant refinement, and to indulge in such activities as government, war, sports, and devout observances but not in productive labor; by "conspicuous consumption" he means the desire to avoid the appearance of poverty and to 
convey an impression of pecuniary strength by spending money in extravagant and 
wasteful ways. The author's interpretation of the term "waste" is a narrowly 
economic one, anything which contributes merely to subjective satisfaction and not 
to definite physical needs being regarded as wasteful; and he carries his theory too 
far in attributing practically every non-utilitarian desire of the leisure class to the 
impulse to show one's financial superiority. But he is a keen observer, with an 
incisive, critical mind, who sees through many insincerities and veiled predatory 
instincts, and few of the leisure classes can read the book without feeling uncomfortable. This discomfort is not lessened by his occasional rather elaborate protests 
that of course he is speaking purely in the economic sense and that no doubt these 
activities may have a high cultural value, but that he is concerned with very practical 
realities. Defenders of the classics are particularly irritated by his treatment of this 
subject as a mere conventional badge of the leisure classes without any practical use 
and hence an admirable example of "conspicuous waste." Religion, the law, business, 
and sports, fare no better. But he has done the leisure classes an admirable service 
in allowing them to see themselves as the industrial classes probably view them. 
The style is unadorned, unemotional, detached, and coolly remorseless. </summary>

An 
English translation appeared in 1911. It consists of a series of rhapsodic discourses 
in impassioned and poetic prose, supposed to be addressed by a Persian sage, Zarathustra, to his disciples and to the people. The discourses, which are divided into four 
books, are provided with striking and romantic titles of a mystical suggestiveness, 
e. g., 'The Three Metamorphoses,' 'The Flies in the Market-Place,' 'The Thousand 
and One Goals,' etc. The general position of the book is that good and evil are purely 
relative and that there is one morality for the strong, vigorous, efficient man, and 
another for the weak, average, subordinate man. The first or "master-morality" is 
governed by the "will to power" and justifies the strong man in dominating over his 
inferiors and giving free scope to the development of his personality. The second, or 
"slave-morality" produces pity, submission, humility all instincts which appeal 
to the weak and sickly who need protection. This latter passive and degenerate 
morality is the basis of Christianity. Thus must give way before a revival of the 
Pagan code, which is active, creative, and which leads to the evolution of a higher 
order of being, the Super-man. A natural corollary of this belief is a hatred of 
democracy and a passionate advocacy of aristocracy.</summary>

crimes, now believed to have been written by Shakespeare, since it often is included 
in the original Folio Edition of 1623. No one who has once supped on its horrors 
will care to read it. Here is a specimen of them: Titus Andronicus, a Roman noble, 
in revenge for the ravishing of his daughter Lavinia and the cutting off of her hands 
and tongue, cuts the throats of the two ravishers, while his daughter holds between 
the stumps of her arms a basin to catch the blood. The father then makes a paste 
of the ground bones and blood of the slain men, and in that paste bakes their two 
heads, and serving them up at a feast, causes their mother to eat of the dish, 
lago seems a gentleman beside the hellish Moor, Aaron, of this blood-soaked

  <summary author="Sterne, Laurence (1713-1768)" title="The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman" print_title="The Life and Opinions\nof Tristram Shandy,\nGentleman">TRISTRAM SHANDY, by Laurence Sterne. The Life and Opinions of Tristram 
Shandy, Gent., is "a heterogeneous sort of whimsical humorous memoirs." The 
first volume appeared January ist, 1760, when Sterne was forty-six. Up to this 
time he had lived the life of an easy-going fox-hunting churchman, utterly obscure; 
but this, his first effort, so amused the public, that he was persuaded to compose 
further in the same strain; and he published in all nine volumes, the last in January, 
1767. The work is full of domestic comedy, "characters of nature, " "the creations 
of a fine fancy working in an ideal element, and not mere copies or caricatures of 
individualities actually observed, " like those of Dickens. Here live old Uncle Toby, 
Corporal Trim, Dr. Slop, and the Widow Wadman; and who does not enjoy their 
garrulous gossip, and that of Sterne himself in his frequent whimsical digressions, so 
full of keen observation and gentle ridicule? Sterne had evidently studied the
humorists well: 'Tristram Shandy' reminds us, now of Cervantes, now of Rabelais, 
now of Swift; but it is sui generis nevertheless. Coleridge praised especially Sterne's 
power of giving significance to "the most evanescent minutiae in thought, feeling, 
look, and gesture.' The work has always been popular, perhaps never more so than 
to-day, when the development of realism in English fiction is receiving so much 
attention.</summary>
  <summary author="Dana, Richard Henry (1815-1882)" title="Two Years Before the Mast" print_title="Two Years\nBefore the Mast">TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST, by Richard Henry Dana. This personal 
narrative of a sailor's life is probably the most truthful and accurate work of its 
character ever written. Although originally published in 1840, the production of a 
youth just out of college, it still holds its charm and its popularity in the face of all 
rivals and successors. The author, upon graduating from Harvard College in the 
year 1837, at the age of twenty-two, was forced to suspend his studies on account 
of an affection of his eyes. Having a strong passion for the sea, he shipped "before 
the mast" upon the brig Pilgrim for a voyage around Cape Horn on a trading trip 
for hides to California. After rounding the Horn the Pilgrim touched at Juan Fernandez; the next land sighted being California, then inhabited only by Indians and a 
few Spaniards. She visited Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Pedro, and finally San 
Diego, the depot of the business. Here Dana remained several months ashore, handling and curing hides. He did not return home in the Pilgrim, but upon the arrival of 
the ship Alert, consigned by the same owners, he procured an exchange to her. The 
voyage home in this vessel is graphically described. While aboard of her Dana 
touched at San Francisco, where, except the Presidio, there then existed one wooden 
shanty only. This was afterwards rebuilt as a one-story adobe house; and long 
remained as the oldest building in the now great city.

The book contains a straightforward and manly account of the life of a foremast band at that date; and it gives in detail the adventures, hardships, and too often 
brutalities, which accompany a seaman's life. Mr. Dana sets forth from his own 
personal experience the thoughts, feelings, enjoyments, and sufferings, as well as the 
real life and character, of the common seaman. In reading it one finds more than 
the ordinary record of a sea voyage; for there runs through the simple and lucid 
narrative an element of beauty and power which gives it the charm of romance. The 
book was immediately successful, passed through many editions, was adopted by the 
British Board of Admiralty for distribution to the navy, and was translated into 
many Continental languages. In 1869 the author added a supplementary chapter 
giving an account of a second visit to California, and the subsequent history of many 
of the persons and vessels mentioned in the original work. William Cullen Bryant, 
who procured the first publication of the book, recommended it to the publishers as 
"equal to Robinson Crusoe"; and the event has justified his forecast, with the additional merit that the story is absolutely real and truthful. </summary>
  <summary author="Stowe, Harriet Beecher (1811-1896)" title="Uncle Tom's Cabin" print_title="Uncle Tom's Cabin">UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, by Harriet Beecher Stowe. This world-famous story was 
written in 1851, and appeared originally, from week to week as written, in the National Era, an abolition paper published at Washington. Brought out in book form 
when completed as a serial, its popularity was immediate and immense. Its influence 
during the last decade of slavery was great, and its part in the creation of anti-slavery 
sentiment incalculable. 

It opens in Kentucky, and closes in Canada. The chapters between are chiefly 
located in Ohio, in New Orleans, beside Lake Pontchartrain, and down upon the Red
River. Their chief purpose is to depict slavery, and the effects of it, by portraying the 
experiences of Uncle Tom, and of those with whom he was more or less connected, 
through the space of some five years. Their chief personages, rather in the order of 
interest than of introduction, are Uncle Tom, the pious and faithful slave, and little 
Eva, to whom he is devoted; Augustine St. Clare, father of Eva, and his complaining 
wife; Mr. and Mrs. Shelby, from whose "old Kentucky home" Uncle Tom is sold 
South; George Shelby, their son, who finally seeks him for repurchase, and finds him 
dying of brutality on that remote Red River plantation; Simon Legree, who bought 
Tom after St. Clare's death (which followed not long after that of Eva) , who owns him 
when he dies, and who represents the brutal slaveholder as St. Claire represents the 
easy and good-humored one; Gassy, once Legree's favorite, now a half-crazed wreck of 
beauty; Emeline, bought to succeed her, but who escapes with Cassy at last; Eliza, 
who proves to be Cassy 's daughter, and to whom she is finally reunited; George Harris, Eliza's husband, who follows her along the "Underground Railway" in Ohio, 
after her wonderful escape across the Ohio River on the ice, carrying her boy Harry; 
Tom Loker, Haley, and Marks, the slave-catchers, who hunt these runaways and are 
overmatched; Simon Halliday and Phineas Fletcher, the Quakers, with their families; 
and Senator and Mrs. Bird, and John Van Trompe, all of whom assist the fugitives; 
Miss Ophelia, the precise New England spinster cousin in St. Clare's home; Topsy, 
the ebony "limb of mischief," who never was born but just "growed"; and Aunt 
Chloe, Uncle Tom's wife back there in "old Kentuck, " whose earnings were to assist 
in his return to her, but to whom he never returns. Other but incidental characters, 
field and household servants, swell the number to fifty-five. 

In a 'Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin,' its author gave matter to sustain both the severe 
and the mild pictures of slavery which her story had drawn.</summary>
  <summary author="Goldsmith, Oliver" title="The Vicar of Wakefield" print_title="The Vicar of Wakefield">VICAR OF WAKEFIELD, THE, Oliver Goldsmith's famous story, was published 
in 1766. Washington Irving said of it: "The irresistible charm this novel possesses, 
evinces how much may be done without the aid of extravagant incident to excite the 
imagination and interest the feelings. Few productions of the kind afford greater 
amusement in the perusal, and still fewer inculcate more impressive lessons of morality." The character of the Vicar, Dr. Primrose, gives the chief interest to the tale. 
His weaknesses and literary vanity are attractive; and he rises to heights almost 
sublime when misfortune overtakes his family. , The other actors in the simple 
drama are Mrs. Primrose, with her boasted domestic qualities and her anxiety to 
appear genteel; the two daughters, Olivia and Sophia; and the two sons, George, 
bred at Oxford, and Moses, who "received a sort of miscellaneous education at home" 
all of whom the Vicar says were "equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive." Squire Thornhill resides near the family, and elopes with Olivia, to the great
distress of the Vicar. He suspects Mr. Burchell, who turns out to be Sir William 
Thornhill, the uncle of the young Squire. Sir William asks for Sophia's hand, and 
sets right the family misfortunes. Numerous pathetic and humorous incidents arise 
out of the story. Among the latter is that of the family picture, which, when finished, was too large for the house. Mrs. Primrose was painted as Venus, the Vicar 
in bands and gown, presenting to her his books on the Whistonian controversy; 
Olivia was an "Amazon sitting upon a bank of flowers, dressed in a green Joseph, 
richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand; Sophia, a shepherdess; Moses, 
dressed out with a hat and white feather"; while the Squire " insisted on being put 
in as one of the family in the character of Alexander the Great, at Olivia's feet." 
Austin Dobson says that the 'Vicar of Wakefield' "remains and will continue to be 
one of the first of our English classics."</summary>

tells of ranch life and cowboy doings. The hero of the tale "the Virginian," by which 
title alone he is known to the reader, has left his native state at an early age to try 
his fortunes in the western country. After roughing it in various places, he is finally 
established on Judge Henry's cattle ranch in Montana, where the owner regards him 
as his right-hand man. He is twenty-seven years of age and strikingly handsome, 
and though unversed in the ways of the world and ignorant as to book learning, he 
has a character and personality which inspire respect from all who know him. His 
high sense of honor, his dauntless courage, and his sympathy for the weak, are constantly shown in the various episodes which occur throughout the story. In Miss 
Molly Wood, a Vermont girl, who tries school-teaching in the West in order to get 
a change of environment, he sees his ideal, and from the moment of his first meeting 
with her, makes up his mind to win her for his wife. He wooes her faithfully for 
three years, during which time she gives him books to read and helps him to become 
better acquainted with the world in which she lives. The difference in their positions and education seems an unsurmountable barrier to Molly and she is on the 
point of returning to Vermont, when she discovers her lover in the woods wounded 
and unconscious, with no succor at hand. She manages to revive him somewhat, 
gets him on his horse, and supports him while she leads the animal a distance of five 
miles to her home. The wound proves to be a serious one, but the Virginian is 
brought through by Molly's devoted care and nursing and when he is convalescing 
he is made happy by her confession that at last love has conquered. They 
are married and after a blissful honeymoon spent camping in the hills, Molly 
takes her cowboy to visit her relatives, an ordeal through which he passes most 
reditably.</summary>
  <summary author="Jonson, Ben" title="Volpone; Or, The Fox" print_title="Volpone;\nOr,\nThe Fox">VOLPONE; or, THE Fox, by Ben Jonson (1605). Volpone which had been 
acted at the Globe Theatre in 1605 or 1606 and repeated at both Oxford and Cambridge was printed in 1607 with a dedication "To the most Noble and most Equal 
Sisters, the Two Famous Universities." The dedication denounces the license of 
protesters and sets up in contrast the ideal for the true poet. "If men will impartially, and not asquint, look toward the offices and function of a poet, they will easily 
conclude to themselves the impossibility of any man's being the good poet, without 
first being a good man." The true poet is "able to inform young men to all good 
disciplines, inflame grown men to all great virtues, keep old men in their best and 
supreme state, or, as they decline to childhood, recover them to their first strength": 
he "comes forth the interpreter and arbiter of nature, a teacher of things divine no 
less than human, a master in manners." The comedy, the scene of which is laid 
in Venice, is a picture of depravities common in all countries at that age, and a 
vigorous satire upon these vices. The story is of a scoundrel magnifico of Venice, 
who in order to attract gifts from friends and followers feigned deadly sickness. He 
and his parasite (Moscha or fly) persuade each of these friends Voltore (vulture) 
Corbuccio (crow), and Corvino (raven), that he is to be the heir of Volpone. All grovel 
and fawn upon him but all are in turn deceived. In the end the parasite rounds 
upon his master, and justice is meted out to all the party. The play long kept its 
place upon the stage, but the depravity of the life depicted makes it unpalatable to 
modern readers. Coleridge, while acknowledging its "fertility and vigor of invention, character, language, and sentiment" declares it impossible "to keep up 
any pleasurable interest in a tale, in which there is no goodness of heart in any of 
the prominent characters."</summary>
  <summary author="Thoreau, Henry David (1817-1862)" title="Walden" print_title="Walden">WALDEN, an autobiographic narrative by Henry D. Thoreau (1854). A sturdy 
individualist, and lover of nature Thoreau retired from the world to live a hermit-like 
existence on the shores of Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts. For two 
years, from 1845 to 1847, he lived in a cottage built by himself at a cost of $28.12. He 
subsisted on the plainest food, mostly corn meal, rice, potatoes, and molasses, tilled his 
own soil, and spent his leisure hours in botanizing, observing animal life, enjoying 
the scenery, reading, and meditation. The book is a discursive record of his experiences, under such headings as 'Economy,' 'Where I Lived and What I Lived 
For,' 'Sounds,' 'Solitude,' 'The Bean-Field,' 'The Ponds,' 'Winter Animals,' 'Spring.' 
Thoreau was a keen observer of birds, fish, animals, and flowers, and has described 
them with truth and attractiveness. He loved to support himself by hardy out-door 
toil in a country civilized enough to be cleared for cultivation ; he did not enjoy the 
wilderness, but preferred the proximity of man. His philosophy is a combination of 
stoicism and asceticism, with an epicurean fondness for the beautiful in natural 
scenery and a Yankee shrewdness, practicality, and humor. His style has the purity 
and simplicity of Emerson's without its abruptness.</summary>
  <summary author="Tolstoy, Leo, graf (1828-1910)" title="War and Peace" print_title="War and Peace">WAR AND PEACE, by Count Leo Tolstoy (1864-69), perhaps the greatest of his 
novels, deals with the stirring conflict between Napoleon and Prance, and Koutouzoff and Russia, beginning some years before Austerlitz. As might be expected of 
one of the most mystical of modem writers, war is treated not alone as a dramatic 
spectacle, but as a symbol of great social forces striving for expression. The novel is a 
combination of mysticism and realism. Tolstoy has portrayed the terror of battle, 
the emotions of armies in conflict, with surpassing skill and power. The book as a 
whole leaves an indelible but confused impression upon the mind of the reader, as
if he had himself passed through the din and smoke of a battle, of which he retains 
great dim memories. But above all is the impression of fatality, and the part that 
accident plays in all campaigns.</summary>

OF THE, by Andrew Dickson White (1896. New ed., 1913) The work grew out of 
a lecture on 'The Battlefields of Science,' delivered by the author in reply to clerical 
and orthodox strictures upon the non-sectarian principles of Cornell University, of 
which he was president. Coming to believe that interference with science in the 
interests of dogmatic theology had always proved harmful not only to science but 
also to religion, and that all free scientific investigation had ultimately benefited 
religion, he proceeded to illustrate this conviction by a book entitled 'The Warfare 
of Science' (1876), a series of magazine articles, 'New Chapters in the Warfare of 
Science,' and at length by the present work. The plan of the book is to take up in 
succession various scientific theories and to trace their progress against vehement 
theological opposition to the time of their general acceptance. Among these theories 
are, the evolution of all species, including man, from lower forms; the sphericity of 
the earth; the heliocentric theory of the universe; the antiquity of the earth and man 
as demonstrated by fossils, weapons, implements, and skeletons, and other geological 
and anthropological discoveries; the gradual moral evolution of man, the attribution 
of witchcraft and insanity to psychic abnormality instead of diabolic influence; tho 
bacterial origin of disease; and the human authorship of the Scriptures. In each case 
the dogmatic view is clearly stated, the growing opposition to it accurately traced, 
the effect of the struggle estimated, and the triumph of the scientific view recorded. 
Full references are given in support of all statements and there is an excellent index, 
but the book is so written as to appeal to the general reader as well as the scholar. 
It is an impressive piece of writing, unified by a great conception.</summary>
  <summary author="Butler, Samuel (1835-1902)" title="The Way of All Flesh" print_title="The Way of All Flesh">WAY OF ALL FLESH, THE, by Samuel Butler (1903). A brilliant satirical novel 
written in the eighties, attacking the institution of the family, especially the relations 
between parents and children, and the religion of the Scribes and Pharisees in the 
Anglican church and its clergy. The life history of the hero, Ernest Ponifex, begins 
with his great grandfather, the carpenter. This attractive old man and Ernest's 
Aunt Althea are his only agreeable relatives. His father, Theobald, has not one 
redeeming feature. He enters the church without vocation because of family pressure. 
He marries without love, and has children whom he dislikes, but he is so self-deceived 
that he regards himself as a model husband and father. Christina, Ernest's mother, 
believes Theobald everything he claims to be. Her satisfaction in herself and Theobald, and the dreams of greatness she indulges in for such deserving people, make her 
the most entertaining character in this amazingly entertaining book. Ernest is in 
complete subjection to his parents, but his instinctive knowledge and hatred of his 
father is the saving grace which keeps him from becoming a like prig and hypocrite, 
and makes Theobald see him as an ungrateful child who does not love his father as he 
ought. Butler attributes the unhappy relations which exist between parents and 
children in part to the Church Catechism "written too exclusively from the parental 
point of view" and quite evidently not the work of one who likes children. Ernest 
escapes from family prayers and Sundays and beatings to school, where he is treated 
with stupidity and brutality by teachers who like teaching because it is tyranny 
made easy. He goes to Cambridge and takes deacon's orders. Ernest's career in the 
Church is cut short by six months in jail for making improper advances to a respectable young lady. It is a profitable time of reflection and mental growth. lie 
casts off Theobald and Christina for a fresh start in life, and marries Ellen who had 
been his mother's maid. They set up a second-hand clothing shop which prospers 
until Ellen goes back to drinking. He rejoices to find himself a bachelor again when 
he learns that she has another husband. The fortune his Aunt Althea left ham, to be 
made known to him when he is twenty-eight, gives him financial independence, and 
he comes through his varied experiences a happy and dignified human being.

Voltaire, "raised the glory of comedy to a greater height than any English writer 
before or since," and Swinburne called 'The Way of the World' "the unequalled and 
nsapszoached masterpiece of English comedy." The play was coolly received on its
first production, and Congreve told the audience bluntly that they could save themselves the trouble of disapproving, as he did not mean to write any more. The chief 
character in the play is Millamant an accomplished elegant lady, who hopes and 
fears nothing and whose law of life is her own caprice. Her conquests have ceased 
to surprise or interest her. "What is it that a lover can give?" she asks, "Why one 
makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as one pleases, and they die 
as soon as one pleases ; and then if one pleases, one makes more." One of Congreve's 
best known lyrics is Millamant's song: 

    "Love's but the frailty of the mind 
    When 'tis not with ambition join'd. 
    If there's delight in love 'tis when I see 
    That heart, which others bleed for, bleed for me." </summary>

A treatise of economic research, of great breadth; but 
specially designed to show the wisdom and justice of free trade among nations. In 
the very wide range of subjects dealt with are found social history, the politics of 
commerce, rules of taxation, and educational theories now generally accepted; but 
the chief burden of the book is freedom of trade among all nations. Its note is international, never considering how one nation may promote its own wealth at the 
expense of other nations. The work is full of facts, shows wealth of varied reading, 
and remarkable sagacity in the use of very imperfect data. The style of the work is 
diffuse, and the arrangement of materials irregular and loose; more in the manner of a 
great study than of a perfectly finished work. To a very large extent it drew from the 
work already done in France by the economists of the "Encyclopedic" school; first 
among whom stood Turgot, whose 'Sur la Formation et la Distribution des Richesses' 
supplied Smith with passages of his first book very closely following the divisions and 
arguments of Turgot. Smith had visited France at the close of the Seven Years' 
War, had spent a year in Paris, and had seen much of the economists there. He had 
returned home in October, 1766, and settled in retirement at Kirkcaldy, where he 
gave ten years to the production of his book. Five English editions of the work 
appeared during its author's life, and it was translated into many modern languages. 
It is at once a great English classic and a landmark in ccpnomical science. The 
earlier life of the author had been that of a professor at the University of Glasgow, 
where he was given the chair of logic in 1751, and that of moral philosophy the next 
year. In 1759 he published 'A Theory of the Moral Sentiments,' of which there were 
six editions during his life. It was his custom to give some attention to political 
economy in his Glasgow lectures; and he then drew those inferences on behalf of 
freedom of trade which he afterwards expanded into his 'Wealth of Nations.' In 
1763 Smith resigned his chair to take charge of the education of the son of the Duke of 
Buccleugh ; and it was on a pension of 300 a year, given him by the duke, that he 
retired to Kirkcaldy. It is said that Pitt thought well of Smith's free-trade views, 
and might in happier times have adopted a free-trade policy; but it was reserved for 
the school of Cobden to induce England to act on them.</summary>
  <summary author="Sumner, William Graham (1840-1910)" title="What Social Classes Owe to Each Other" print_title="What Social Classes\nOwe to Each Other">WHAT SOCIAL CLASSES OWE TO EACH OTHER, by William Graham Sumner. 
This work, published in 1883, was written by the professor of political economy in 
Yale University, and was intended to explode the fallacy of regarding the State as 
something more than the people of which it is composed. Every attempt to make the 
State cure a social ill, Mr. Sumner says, is an attempt to make some people take care 
of others. It is not at all the function of the State to make men happy; to say that 
those who by their own labor and industry have acquired or augmented a fortune 
shall support the shiftless and negligent, is to strike at the liberty of the industrious. 
Evils due to the folly and wickedness of mankind bear their own bitter fruit; State 
interference in such cases means simply making the sober, industrious, and prudent 
pay the penalty which should be borne by the offender. The type and formula of 
most philanthropic schemes is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what 
C shall do for D. Poor C, the "forgotten man, " has to pay for the scheme, without 
having any voice in the matter. " Class distinctions simply result from the different 
degrees of success with which men have availed themselves of the chances which 
were presented to them. In the prosecution of these chances, we all owe to each 
other good-will, mutual respect, and mutual guarantees of liberty and security. 
Beyond this nothing can be affirmed as a duty of one group to another in a 
free State." 

Professor Sumner's book is a useful antidote to many of the futile and dreamy 
socialistic schemes now afloat. A process warranted to regenerate the world in a day 
always has its attractions. Professor Sumner, however, is a more thorough-going 
supporter of the "laissez-faire" doctrine than most economists of the present day. 
Besides, he disregards the very dishonest means by which wealth is often attained. 
His defense of the capitalist class is not quite reasonable: not all capitalists, we know, 
arc the despicable villains described by the extreme socialists; but neither could all 
of them be regarded as men who have simply made legitimate use of "the chances 
presented to them." However, Professor Sumner's protest against the insidious 
attacks on the liberty of the majority, under the specious guise of legislative aid for 
the weak, is straightforward and convincing.</summary>

the first of these Fields had a personal acquaintance; with Hawthorne, Thackeray,

between publisher and author is of a delicate nature, having in it elements of mutual 
interest and enforced intimacy; when to this is added the tie of kindred mind and 
personal predilection, the record of it is noteworthy. The title is particularly applicable to the subject-matter. The remembrance of the day before is so potent in the 
present; yesterday and to-day are so allied in sentiment, that in reading these charming recollections, conversations, letters, anecdotes of work and play, one feels that 
the veil has been withdrawn, and those to whom we owe so much entertainment 
and instruction are still with us, not merely portraits in a picture gallery revivified 
by the touch of the artist. The author's recollections of Dickens are exceptionally 
interesting. To him is accorded a major portion of the book, as in life was accorded 
a greater share of time and affection.</summary>
