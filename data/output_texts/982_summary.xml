<summary author="Cowper, William (1731-1800)" title="The Task, and Other Poems" print_title="The Task,\nand Other Poems" new_author_name="Cowper, William (1731-1800)">TASK, THE, a descriptive and reflective poem by William Cowper, published in 1785. 
It was begun at the instance of the poet's friend, Georgina Austen, who playfully asked 
him to write a poem in blank-verse about a sofa. Accepting the challenge Cowper 
traces in about one hundred Miltonic lines the evolution of the sofa from the chair. 
He then proceeds discursively to enlarge on the pleasures of country walks, the delights of gardening, and the coziness of the winter fireside, mingling these descriptive 
passages with autobiographic records of religious experience, satirical attacks on the 
luxury of cities, the corruption of politicians and the worldliness of the clergy, pietistic 
denunciations of deism, skepticism, and natural science, and outbursts of humanitarian sympathy for slaves, blind animals, and all who are oppressed. These and 
other topics occupy six books entitled respectively: 'The Sofa,' 'The Time-Piece' 
(i.e., the omens of future judgment), 'The Garden,' 'The Winter Dinner,' 'The 
Winter Morning Walk,' 'The Winter Walk at Noon.' 'The Task' reflects the
enthusiasm for natural scenery, the impulse to self-revelation, and the eagerness to 
relieve suffering, of the later eighteenth century. The novelist is a refined, sensitive 
Christian countryman with a gift of easy, graceful expression, and a nature of little 
sensibility and quiet humor. The neurotic strain which so sadly affected his peace 
and happiness left no trace on this poem.</summary>
